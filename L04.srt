10
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,016
PROFESSOR: All right.

11
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:05,930
Welcome back to 6.890.

12
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,780
Today we start a series of
lectures on satisfiability.

13
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,590
We saw a little bit
about satisfiability

14
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,620
in the first lecture.

15
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,930
Now we're going to do it right,
and do it more intensely,

16
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,110
and see a lot of examples.

17
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,300
Today we'll just
see a few examples

18
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,080
of using SAT to prove
NP-completeness or NP-hardness.

19
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,590
But over the next lecture or two
we will see many more examples.

20
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,560
And SAT is really the
most common problem

21
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,830
that everyone uses
to prove NP-hardness.

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,490
So this is the moment you've
all been waiting for, I suppose.

23
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,130
This is one of the
motivations for organizing

24
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,700
this whole class, so we
can tell you all about SAT,

25
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,140
it's many variations, so
you get to learn them all,

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,830
and then see lots
of different ways

27
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,510
you can SAT to
represent your problems.

28
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,680
So without further
ado, let's get started.

29
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,880

30
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,080
Today I'm going to give you
a whole bunch of problems

31
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,434
and definitions, and then we
will do reductions afterwards.

32
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,350
So there's going to be
a lot of problems here.

33
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,600
You probably will have
trouble remembering them all,

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,540
there are so many.

35
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,142
But in particular,
the notes serve

36
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,600
as a useful reference,
like, here's

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
all the versions you
might care about-- here's

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,340
which ones are hard,
which ones are easy.

39
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,550
So with that in mind,
get ready for the ride.

40
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,570
So the original SAT
problem is you're

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:43,680
given a Boolean formula, which
is like over the operators

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,105
AND, OR, and NOT.

43
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,730
And in case you look
at the literature,

44
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,260
usually AND is the wedge, OR
is the vee, and NOT is the neg?

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,050
I don't know the
name of that symbol.

46
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:08,930
And it's over n
variables x_1, x_2, ... x_n.

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,680
So usually, you're not
given true or false

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,470
so that you can construct
them by saying, x_1 and not x_ 1.

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,220
That's never true.

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,530
So that's false, for example.

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,870
And then you could
negate that and get true.

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,290
And the question is, can
you set the variables

53
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,470
to make the formula true?

54
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:35,920

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,630
So that's the general problem.

56
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,330
This is the very
first problem proved

57
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,704
to be NP-complete by
Cook and then by Levin.

58
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,620
So it's usually called
the Cook-Levin theorem,

59
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,550
that satisfiability
is NP-complete.

60
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,070
And I was looking at
the paper the other day.

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,870
It doesn't actually mention
the notion of NP in that paper.

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
I think that came later.

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,160
But the notion is there.

64
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:12,470
So I'll give you another
version of the same problem,

65
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,100
essentially, called circuit SAT.

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,050
This is a useful perspective
which we will see probably

67
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,150
not till next class.

68
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,995
But another way
to think about it.

69
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,370
Also makes  the
NP-completeness

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,536
a little bit more intuitive.

71
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:32,391

72
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:32,890
OK.

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,790
This is kind of the algebraic
way of thinking about things.

74
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,310
You have variables and
you write operators,

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,030
and you use parentheses
and that sort of thing.

76
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,930
But if you're more
graphically inclined,

77
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,890
you could imagine you
have your x_is as wires,

78
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,279
they're connected to gates--
this is an AND gate, this is

79
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,540
an OR gate, this is a negation.

80
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,400
So you can imagine
something like this.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,290
So you can, generally, copy
your data and do various things.

82
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,297
And then this is the output.

83
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,255
And so this is what you
might call the formula.

84
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,270

85
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,200
It is the AND of the
negation of the OR of x_3

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,030
and the AND of x_1 and x_2.

87
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,900
And then, pop off, it's also
ANDed with this thing again.

88
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,890
So the one advantage
of circuit SAT

89
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,040
is you can reuse complex
computations, just

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,660
by copying the signal.

91
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,860
Normally, in a formula,
you'd have to copy and paste

92
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,990
that chunk of the formula.

93
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,310
So you could imagine this
lets you write formulas

94
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,050
slightly more efficiently.

95
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,750
I think it doesn't.

96
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,770
If you reuse things, you
can always write them

97
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,420
as a variable over here.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,292
Question.

99
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,046
AUDIENCE: What about feedback?

100
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,420
PROFESSOR: Feedback
is forbidden.

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,390
So this should be a
directed acyclic graph.

102
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,910
Yeah.

103
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,360
Good question.

104
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,000
So it's an acyclic circuit.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,860
That would be another problem,
which is harder than sNP.

106
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,570
So circuit SAT is
NP-complete when it's acyclic

107
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,895
and you can convert
between one and the other.

108
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,395
And it's a little
bit more intuitive

109
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:20,590
that you can write arbitrary
computations as a circuit.

110
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,860
And then this is a question
of whether you can--

111
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,100
the existence of some
setting of the x_i's

112
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,110
is the same thing
as saying, is there

113
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,840
some set of guesses that
will lead me to a yes answer?

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,070
So that is intuitively
like NP and that's

115
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,080
roughly how you prove these
problems are NP-complete.

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,610
You write the computation--
the checking computation--

117
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,730
to see whether your certificate
is a valid certificate

118
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,050
as a circuit or as a formula.

119
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,170
And then the existential
quantifiers on the x_i's let you

120
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,890
do all the guessing to see
whether they're-- and this is

121
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,580
biased, right?

122
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,040
It's trying to find a true.

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,420
And that's exactly what NP does.

124
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,160
It's trying to find a true path
that ends up answering yes.

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,510
So yes and true
are symmetric here.

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,830
So that's the extent of
complexity theory

127
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,610
we'll do today.

128
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,090
I'm going to give you
more versions of SAT.

129
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,180
Next one is CNF SAT.

130
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,270
CNF stands for
conjunctive normal form.

131
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:30,220

132
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,170
I hope you all know
propositional logic.

133
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,390
Because we're going to
be doing a bunch today.

134
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,610
So ANDs are also
called conjunctions,

135
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,400
ORs are called disjunctions.

136
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,640
This is old terminology.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:49,800
So conjunctive normal form
means that your formula

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
is an AND of clauses.

139
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,830

140
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,870
What's a clause?

141
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,360
Well a clause is going
to be an OR of literals.

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,412

143
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:07,120
What's a literal?

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,320

145
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,850
A literal is going
to be x_i or not x_i.

146
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,400

147
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,450
So these are variables.

148
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,200
So variables are
possible literals

149
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,210
and the negations of variables
and literals, and that's it.

150
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,430
And that is CNF SAT.

151
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,750
So it's a special case of SAT
where your formula happens

152
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,140
to have this picture.

153
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,790
And in general, you can
convert arbitrary formulas

154
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,530
into conjunctive normal form.

155
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,110
It's a normal form, meaning
it's essentially unique.

156
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,940
A minimal CNF formula is unique.

157
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,640
So there's a known
transformation

158
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,084
to do that, polynomial time.

159
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,500
That's how you
prove this is hard.

160
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,370

161
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,500
Another view in this picture--

162
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,590
We'll use CNF SAT a lot, usually
in even more specialized form.

163
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,100
But already, one
useful view-- which

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,090
we saw a little bit in lecture
one, we'll see it again today--

165
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,720
is you can view such an
input as a bipartite graph.

166
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:22,820
You have, let's say,
variables on the one side

167
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,940
and clauses on the other side.

168
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,970
And then you have two
types of connections,

169
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,700
a clause-- in general, a clause
is going to have degree three.

170
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,050
And let's say the
dashed edges are negated

171
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,820
and the solid edges
are not negated.

172
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,785
So this is a clause that
involves x_1 or x_2 or not x_3.

173
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:49,980

174
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,600
And in general, each
of these clauses

175
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,030
is going to involve some
number of variables over here.

176
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,630
I said three, but I haven't
actually gotten to three yet.

177
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,010
That is 3SAT.

178
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,540
So the most common
form of CNF SAT we use

179
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:13,630
is called 3SAT, where it's CNF
SAT in the special case where

180
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,590
the clause is an
or three literals.

181
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,501
And you can assume it's
exactly three or at most three.

182
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,750
So that's like saying the
degree of each of the clause

183
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,460
nodes here is exactly three.

184
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,010

185
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,770
And that's the
problem with it we

186
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,710
used for proving Super
Mario Brothers was

187
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,270
hard in the first lecture.

188
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,680
So in my notes I have
things nicely indented.

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,590
So we had CNF SAT, which
is a special case of SAT,

190
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,000
and then 3SAT, which is a
special case of CNF SAT.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,752
A special case of 3SAT that's
also hard is called 3SAT-5.

192
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,460
I don't know that this
is super standard,

193
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,710
but I found at least one
paper that gives it this name.

194
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:04,010
This says that each
variable occurs in less than

195
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,650
or equal to five clauses, either
in it's positive or negated

196
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,680
form.

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,790
So this is sometimes called
max five occurrence 3-SAT.

198
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,900
And I think you can even make
them exactly five occurrances

199
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,110
if you want.

200
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,471
But, at most, five occurrances
is usually what you want.

201
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:22,970
Question.

202
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,124
AUDIENCE: Is that
tight? Is 3SAT-4 in P?

203
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,540
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

204
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,240
3SAT-4?

205
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,550
I don't know.

206
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,274
I would guess it's tight.

207
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,440
Because there are a lot of
people that mention five,

208
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,131
but I haven't seen a mention
that four is polynomial.

209
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:39,630
All right?

210
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,020
So we should figure that out.

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,730
Other questions?

212
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,971
Or it's probably the same one.

213
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,470
All right.

214
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,850
Here's another
special case of 3SAT.

215
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,940

216
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,810
Monotone 3SAT.

217
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,570

218
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:09,475
This is where each clause is
all positive or all negative.

219
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:15,240

220
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,510
So of course, if every
clause is all positive,

221
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,860
then you could set all
the variables to true

222
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,120
and you'll satisfy.

223
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,536
If all the classes are negative,
you set all the variables

224
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:26,920
to false and you satisfy.

225
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,374
But if half the clauses
are all positive,

226
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,540
half the clauses are all
negative, then that's hard.

227
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,100
That's called monotone 3SAT.

228
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,340
I've actually not
seen this used,

229
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,965
but I imagine it is helpful
in a few situations.

230
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,570

231
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,080
This is definitely
the most common.

232
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,059
Almost every proof
starts with 3SAT.

233
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,100
But it's really good to
know all the extra things

234
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,600
you can assume about your 3SAT
problem and it still be hard.

235
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,350

236
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,720
I have more hard versions,
but before we get there

237
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,389
I'm going to tell you
about some easy versions.

238
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:57,930
And question.

239
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,480
AUDIENCE: Is monotone 3SAT-5?

240
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,870
PROFESSOR: Another
good question.

241
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,880
Monotone 3SAT-5, is
that NP complete?

242
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,540
I don't know.

243
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,410
Partly these were done
at different times.

244
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,250

245
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,680
Monotone 3SAT is mentioned
in Garey and Johnson

246
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,650
as done in 1978, presumably for
a particular hardness proof.

247
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,010
3SAT-5 is probably
a very old idea.

248
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,280
Probably this idea of
reducing occurances

249
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,410
goes to some logic thing.

250
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,470
But the earliest reference
I found was 1998,

251
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,090
and most people had forgotten
about monotone 3SAT by then.

252
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,556
So it probably just
hasn't been considered,

253
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:35,430
but it might be easy.

254
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,930
Yeah.

255
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,049

256
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,340
AUDIENCE: The construction
to limit to five variables

257
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,727
should I believe work with the
monotone construction as well.

258
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:46,310
PROFESSOR: OK.

259
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,170
Conjecture.

260
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,050
Yes, it's hard.

261
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,790

262
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,290
OK.

263
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,670

264
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,970
But stay tuned for
a certain answer.

265
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,650
So let me tell you
some polynomial time

266
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,750
versions of SAT.

267
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,350
The three is tight:
if you have a clause

268
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,450
being an or of two literals,
but otherwise they're

269
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,650
just like 3SAT -- or
just like CNF SAT,

270
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,350
I guess -- then this
is polynomial time.

271
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,200
And let me give you
a rough sketch why.

272
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,070
So if you have an
or of two literals,

273
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,940
that's something like x or y.

274
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,810
And the little bit of
propositional logic

275
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,880
you should know is the meaning
of, let's say, a implies b.

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
Saying this should
hold-- and a and b

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,657
are either true or false-- is
the same as saying not a or b.

278
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,240
Because if a is false, then the
implication tells you nothing.

279
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,000
If a is true, then it better
be the case that b is true.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,514
So either a is
false, in which case

281
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,430
you don't worry about
something, or a is true,

282
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,310
and then b better
be true, as well.

283
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,580
So these are the same--
maybe write triple

284
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,910
equals, for these are
equivalent logical statements.

285
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,120
So we can apply
that here and say

286
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,140
x or y is the same thing
as not x implies y,

287
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,486
or not y implies x.

288
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,110
It's symmetric.

289
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,800
This is now just
a simple implication.

290
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,420
If we ever set x to be
false, then y must be true.

291
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,570
And every clause
can be converted

292
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,660
into such an implication.

293
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,870
You can build a graph of
all such implications.

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,020
And then, turns out, to
solve 2SAT, you can just

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,834
pick your favorite variable,
x_i, set it to true,

296
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,500
follow all implications,
see whether you

297
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,710
get a contradiction.

298
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,800
If you don't, then
the claim is there

299
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,890
is a satisfying assignment
where x_i equals true.

300
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,000
So you can try that
with x_i true, x_i false.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,740
If there's any hope,
then one of them

302
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,910
should say no contradiction.

303
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,970
Then just run with that.

304
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,780
And you can prove by induction
that won't get stuck.

305
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,010
It won't make any
impossible assignments,

306
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,840
unless there was no
assignment to begin with.

307
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,850
So that's why 2SAT is easy
and one of the situations

308
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,910
you should be careful about.

309
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,330
On the other hand,
MAX 2SAT is hard.

310
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,470
So MAX 2SAT is
you're given a 2SAT

311
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,020
formula-- you're
given a 2CNF formula--

312
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,880
and normally, we ask for an
assignment to the variables

313
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,410
that satisfies all the
clauses, but if you just

314
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:36,460
want to satisfy k of them--
so satisfy k of the clauses.

315
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,050
So usually you
want to maximize k,

316
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,610
but let's say, for a decision
problem, I'll give you k

317
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,030
and I want to know, can you
satisfy k of the clauses?

318
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,690
That problem is NP hard.

319
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,060

320
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,350
So that can be useful.

321
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,030
If you can only
represent 2SAT clauses,

322
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,220
but you can somehow get
a maximization thing in,

323
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,660
then you're golden again.

324
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,840
But 2SAT alone is not enough.

325
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,710
There are some other
easy-to-solve versions.

326
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,390
This is essentially a
generalization of 2SAT

327
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,290
is Horn SAT.

328
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,855

329
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:13,480
It's maybe a little
bit more surprising

330
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,850
the first time you see it.

331
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,799
Again, it's a special
case of CNF SAT, which

332
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,090
you can tell by my indentation.

333
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:27,920

334
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,580
Each clause has at most
one negative literal.

335
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,240

336
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,670
So that means a clause is
going to look something

337
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,250
like-- has one negative?

338
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,401
Sorry.

339
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:41,900
Sorry.

340
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,400
Horn is the other way around.

341
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,530
We will get-- that
problem is also solvable.

342
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,440
But the one that's called
Horn SAT is-- there's

343
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
at most one positive literal.

344
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,830
So that means
you're formula is going

345
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,999
to look something like not
x or not y are not z or w.

346
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,580
So there's one positive.

347
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,310
The rest are all negated.

348
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,940
And we can do some more
propositional logic.

349
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,050
So use De Morgan's theorem.

350
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,015
This is the same thing as
the negation of the AND.

351
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:16,800

352
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,300
OK?

353
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,280
And then we can apply
this helpful rule.

354
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,890
And say this is the same thing
as if x and y and z are true,

355
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,400
then w better be true.

356
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,080
And so you can use essentially
the same algorithm that

357
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,550
you're-- I mean,
slightly harder to check.

358
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,760
If all three of these
things are true,

359
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,860
then this one better be true.

360
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,590
But it's always a guarantee.

361
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,690
You know this thing must happen.

362
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,250
Just like in 2-SAT, if x
happened to be set to false,

363
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,459
then you know y must be true.

364
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,458
So you can just follow
these implication chains.

365
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,855
If you get a contradiction,
you know you're in trouble.

366
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,230
If you don't get
a contradiction,

367
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,840
again, you can
prove by induction

368
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,030
that all will be well.

369
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,616
And so you just
make sure every time

370
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,740
you assign a variable you
don't get a contradiction

371
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,530
and you can satisfy
any Horn formula.

372
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,180
So that's cool.

373
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:22,234

374
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,650
So I didn't write
it on the board,

375
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,460
but this is
polynomially solvable.

376
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,200
There's a symmetric version,
which is called Dual Horn SAT.

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,520

378
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,170
So this is the same thing, but
at most one negative literal

379
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,590
in each clause.

380
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,600
And this is also solvable
in polynomial time

381
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,650
because you can just negate all
the variables in your formula.

382
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,150
And then when you
get an answer, you

383
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,910
can negate all the
variables again

384
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,410
to get the solution to
the original problem.

385
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,710
So because you can
solve Horn SAT,

386
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,348
you can solve Dual Horn SAT.

387
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:06,330

388
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,780
Cool.

389
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,990
One more bad case I'll
mention now is DNF SAT.

390
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,240
You might say, well, why do
we make things ANDs of ORs?

391
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,090
What about ORs of ANDs?

392
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,902
So DNF is disjunctive
normal form,

393
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,735
meaning the disjunctions
are on the outside.

394
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:32,640

395
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:42,412
So the formula is an
AND of ORs-- sorry.

396
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,620
AUDIENCE: It's an OR of ANDs.

397
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,495
PROFESSOR: Other way.

398
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:48,690

399
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,060
OR of ANDs of literals.

400
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,940
We use some shorthand,
not-defined clauses

401
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,856
here because we don't
really use this problem,

402
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:01,970
because it's polynomial time.

403
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,364
Why is it polynomial time?

404
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,580
AUDIENCE: You can just
evaluate one of the ANDs.

405
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,960
PROFESSOR: Just evaluate
one of the ANDs.

406
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,210
If you--

407
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,110
AUDIENCE: If it's true.

408
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,818
PROFESSOR: Right.

409
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,420
It's true if any one
of these is possible.

410
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,350
So you can just check for
obvious contradictions, like x_i

411
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,910
and not x_i.

412
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,220
If that happens, then
that clause is impossible.

413
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,170
Throw it away.

414
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,170
If any clause has no
internal contradictions,

415
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,824
then just satisfy the clause.

416
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,560
OK?

417
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,520
It's basically-- the answer is
yes whenever there is a clause.

418
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,380
It could be of the empty
formula, no clauses.

419
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,350
So writing-- you can also
write any formula into DNF.

420
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,070
It's like an enumeration of
all the true possibilities.

421
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,880
But it takes exponential
time to do so.

422
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,800
So it's a funny asymmetry
between AND and OR.

423
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,621
That's life.

424
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,120
Yeah.

425
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,769
AUDIENCE: I just want
to say, for Horn SAT,

426
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,810
even if you don't have
Horn SAT or Dual Horn SAT,

427
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,393
you might have a formula where
some renaming-- not necessarily

428
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,810
all of the literals--
but renaming just some

429
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,610
of the literals will
put it in Horn SAT.

430
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,590
And that's also in--

431
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,173
PROFESSOR: Oh.

432
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,670
Just negating some of them.

433
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

434
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,660
Like, each time a
variable occurs,

435
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,090
you have to negate all the
instances of that variable.

436
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,590
But these are called
renamable Horn formulas.

437
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,937
And it's also-- finding the
renaming is linear time.

438
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:15,520
PROFESSOR: OK.

439
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,595
So some kind of renamable Horn.

440
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:22,900

441
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,066
And by renaming, you just
mean negating, right?

442
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:25,690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

443
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,860
The term used in the
literature is renamable Horn.

444
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:35,040
PROFESSOR: There exists
a negation of, let's say,

445
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:45,790
some subset of the
variable's x such that Horn.

446
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,290
OK?

447
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,600
That's the very concise version.

448
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,266
So you get to choose some of the
variables to negate and make it

449
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,195
a Horn clause that's
also polynomial time.

450
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,380
Cool.

451
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,083
Thank you.

452
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,710

453
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,060
You might be wondering at this
point, how am I supp-- I mean,

454
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,027
do I have to remember
all of these?

455
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:04,360
And in some sense
the answer is yes.

456
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,644
But there is actually
a dichotomy theorem

457
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:09,310
that will tell you
which versions of SAT

458
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,260
are polynomial time and
which versions are NP-hard,

459
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,330
and we'll cover that
in one more page.

460
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,260
But I'm-- well, all of these
are involved in the statement

461
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,180
of that dichotomy.

462
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,770
Not quite all, but most of them.

463
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,340
So it's not exactly a shortcut.

464
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:40,390

465
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,730
I would say a lot of
the time, the problem

466
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,160
you're working with
does not naturally

467
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,560
map onto ANDs and ORs.

468
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,870
It sort of involves bits of
some sort-- there's a 0 and a 1

469
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,280
notion-- but they may not really
correspond to logical notions

470
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,980
of true or false.

471
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,350
And the operations
you can do on them

472
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,130
may not correspond to AND or
OR, or anything nice like that.

473
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,220
So the next two versions
of SAT are in that spirit.

474
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,160

475
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,217
So this is usually, these
days, called 1-in-3 SAT,

476
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:17,050
but originally it was
called exactly-1 3SAT.

477
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:26,260

478
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,410
So this is going to be a little
bit weirder to write down,

479
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,350
but like CNF SAT, the formula is
the end of a bunch of clauses.

480
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,890
So that part's the same.

481
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,340
But now we're going
to make a clause

482
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,190
to be a relation on
three variables, which

483
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:57,350
is that exactly one of, let's
say, x_i, x_j, and x_k is true.

484
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,180
So this means it could be
true-false-false, x_i is true,

485
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,710
but the other two are false,
it could be x_j is true,

486
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,720
the other two are false, or
it could be that x_sk is true

487
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,400
and the other two are false.

488
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,140
But those are the only
happy assignments.

489
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,640
Question.

490
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,197
AUDIENCE: Is it exactly one
of three variables or three

491
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:17,830
literals?

492
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,460
PROFESSOR: Good question.

493
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,209
The original statement
is its variables,

494
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:24,250
so that's how I wrote it.

495
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,900
This is usually called monotone.

496
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,840
These days it's usually
called monotone 1-in-3SAT.

497
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't know how
usually exactly.

498
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Sometimes it's called
all-positive 1-in-3SAT.

499
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,930

500
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:47,610
So let's say literals
equal variables.

501
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,220
You could, of course,
if you want, consider

502
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,570
a more general version where
you can have negations.

503
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,674
But you don't need
to, so why bother.

504
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,590
That fact is usually
forgotten in most proofs.

505
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,790
So you'll see in the
literature a reduction

506
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,620
from 1-in-3SAT with
negations, and they

507
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,578
have a negation gadget.

508
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:06,610
It's like, you don't need
to have a negation gadget.

509
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,620
So why not skip it?

510
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,410
But there you go.

511
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,010
Now I'll just mention
I'm not a fan of the word

512
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,460
monotone here because here
we have monotone to mean

513
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,700
all positive or all negative.

514
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,225
Here we mean all positive.

515
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,850

516
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,150
Not ideal reuse of terminology.

517
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,650
I think that's why sometimes
this is all positive 1-in-3SAT.

518
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,084
Anyway, it's a bit of a mess.

519
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,750
But that is the state
of the literature.

520
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,710
So you get it all.

521
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,130
All right.

522
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,235
Here's another problem.

523
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,820

524
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,400
Monotone not-exactly-1 3SAT.

525
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,990

526
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,540
I should not have
any suspense here.

527
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,810
This is in P.

528
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,340
OK?

529
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,610
This is NP-complete.

530
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,690
This is also NP-complete.

531
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,960
But not-exactly-1
3SAT is polynomial.

532
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,760
So I think you
know what it means.

533
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,440
A clause specifies that-- again,
we take an AND of clauses.

534
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:17,890
And we want zero, two, or three
of three variables are true.

535
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,600
In other words, exactly
one of them is false.

536
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,710
No.

537
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,450
I don't mean that.

538
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,280
Exactly one of them being
false would be 1-in-3SAT again,

539
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,020
just by negating
everything, which we're

540
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,610
allowed to do if we want to.

541
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,400
But this is different.

542
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
This is saying, it could
be everything's false,

543
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,474
or it could be one
thing is false,

544
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,015
or it could be zero
things are false.

545
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,960

546
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,220
But not two things are false.

547
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,720
OK?

548
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,640
This turns out to be polynomial.

549
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,190
And do I have-- oh.

550
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,910
There's one funny
thing here, which

551
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,610
is if all your clauses
look like this,

552
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,970
you can set all your
variables to false.

553
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,370
So this is sort of
a trivial problem.

554
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,100
But to make it more
interesting, you

555
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,980
can say x_1 equals true,
just to get you started.

556
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,260
So there's no
trivial solution then

557
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,000
and it still turns
out this is easy.

558
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,210
Because if you think
about this long enough,

559
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,620
as I did yesterday,
this will look something

560
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:35,030
like-- if you have
three variables,

561
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,180
either they're all false--
then fine-- or if one of them

562
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,139
is true, then you better
have another one true.

563
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:43,429
That's a way of saying if
there's at least one of them,

564
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,810
there better be at least two.

565
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,680
That's what we want.

566
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,520
This has to be true for
all shifts of i, j, k.

567
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,770
So for each of i, j, k,
if one of them is true,

568
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,450
you want to imply
the OR of the other.

569
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:00,310
And this is the same
as NOT x_i or x_j or x_k.

570
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,810
Don't need the
parentheses because it's

571
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,670
associative communicative.

572
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,930
And that is a dual horn clause.

573
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,240
And that's why
this is polynomial.

574
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,740
Question.

575
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,906
AUDIENCE: I think I'm
confused about the definition.

576
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:17,640
Why can't they just
all be true then?

577
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,530
PROFESSOR: Good question.

578
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,340
Let's say x_2 is false.

579
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,800
I should double check.

580
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,110
I don't remember that in the
statement of the problem.

581
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,650
We do not allow negations here.

582
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,870
Once you allow negations,
this trick won't work.

583
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,497
But if these appear
all in positive form,

584
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:35,330
then we can convert
into the single negative

585
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,240
and get dual horn.

586
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,740
Question.

587
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,340
AUDIENCE: Are you allowed to
mix the zero, two, and threes?

588
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,580
Or does it have to be all
the clauses have to be--

589
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,700
PROFESSOR: All causes
look like-- all clauses

590
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,520
say, zero, two, or three
of these three variables

591
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,297
must be true.

592
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:51,630
You can't have a clause that
says zero of these are true

593
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,390
and two of these are true.

594
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:52,610
AUDIENCE: No.

595
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,693
But if you have two of
these clauses that give you

596
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,680
all those choices,
can you choose

597
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,690
one to be zero and then
have another one be two,

598
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,220
or whatever.

599
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,950
PROFESSOR: For each clause,
it's an independent choice

600
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,720
whether you have zero, two, or
three of the variables true.

601
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,670
Yeah.

602
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,620
So this OR is local
to the clause.

603
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,760
Other questions?

604
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,230
So it's still an AND of
things that-- it's just

605
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,450
we have a weirder relation.

606
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,825
Instead of just taking the OR
of a bunch of things, which

607
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,810
would be saying at least
one of them is true,

608
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:25,120
now we allow zero or two or
three of them to be true.

609
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,450
OK.

610
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,690
One more version, then
we'll get to-- well, one

611
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,240
and a half more
versions-- then we'll

612
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,576
get to the dichotomy theorem.

613
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:44,380

614
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,560
So next one is
Not-All-Equal 3SAT.

615
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:56,782

616
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:58,240
I feel like that's
about all I need

617
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,970
to write down, other than the
fact that it is NP-complete.

618
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,680
But just in case,
what this means is

619
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,170
a clause is something
like Not-All-Equal

620
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,100
of three variables again.

621
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,660

622
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,810
And this is what I'm defining
is going to be the Monotone

623
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:26,880
Not-All-Equal 3SAT--
which is also hard--

624
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:36,010
where these are variables,
not just literals.

625
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:41,110
So no negations in Monotone
Not-All-Equal 3SAT.

626
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,820
Again, the original
proof already

627
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,770
had monotonicity in there, so
there's no work to be done.

628
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,270
Cool.

629
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,370
So not-all-equal just
means that they're not

630
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,740
all the same values.

631
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,120
So that means not all
true and not all false.

632
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,980
Not TTT and not FFF.

633
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,530
I really like this
version of 3SAT

634
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,520
because it's
completely symmetric

635
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,570
between true and false.

636
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,996
I mean, not at the clause level.

637
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:09,370
Every clause has
to be satisfied.

638
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,286
Those are ANDed together
in the logical level.

639
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,745
But the x_i's are
treated completely

640
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,286
symmetrically between
true and false.

641
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,910
You could just call
them red and blue.

642
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,250
There's no reason to think
one is true one is false.

643
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,180
You just can't have them all be
the same color within a clause.

644
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,680
OK.

645
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,222
So you could think of it as
a problem on hypergraphs.

646
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:28,430
Three uniform hypergraphs,
you have all these triples

647
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,550
of things.

648
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,460
You just want them to not
all be colored the same.

649
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,140
So it means two of one, one of
the other, two trues and one

650
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,350
false, two reds and one
blue, two falses, one true.

651
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,694
They're all this--
those are all good cases

652
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,860
and these are the bad cases.

653
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,400

654
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,790
Cool.

655
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,724
AUDIENCE: So this is
1-or-2-in-3SAT?

656
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:52,390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

657
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,640
You can think of this
exactly 1-or-2-

658
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,720
in-3SAT, if you want to
phrase it in this style.

659
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,220
OK.

660
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,300
So ideally, you should
remember all of these.

661
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,910
But I'll tell you the most
important ones are regular

662
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,960
3SAT-- that's at least one
of each thing is true--

663
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,740
exactly-1 3SAT, or 1-in-3SAT --
where exactly one of the things

664
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,540
is true, and adding
more things breaks it --

665
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,890
and Not-All-Equal 3SAT.

666
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,150
Those are the three
important ones

667
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,590
to know from a lower
bounds perspective.

668
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,230
These others are,
like, be careful

669
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,271
that you don't fall into
one of these things that

670
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:28,370
is polynomial.

671
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,907
So occasionally MAX
2SAT is the one other

672
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,990
that would be useful here.

673
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,050
But remember these guys.

674
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,972
They're super handy.

675
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,180
Because what will happen
when you're proving hardness

676
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,860
is you fool around
and you try to find--

677
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,830
you build a gadget that
has two truths-- two

678
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,320
possible ways to satisfy it.

679
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,260
Call one red and one blue
or one true and one false.

680
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,250
And then you try different
ways to combine three of them.

681
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,140
And you're trying to get--
you need some other things--

682
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,290
but you're trying to
get clause gadgets.

683
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:04,090
Trying to get them to--
when you combine three

684
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,310
wires into a little
gadget, you want

685
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,140
them to be constrained somehow.

686
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,520
That in order to be
globally OK, something

687
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,572
must hold locally at
those three things.

688
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,780
And it might end up being
a Not-All-Equal constraint,

689
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,696
it might end up being
an exactly-1 constraint,

690
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:19,330
or it might end up
being a 3SAT constraint.

691
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,010
With some negations
to make it happy,

692
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,970
it should be one of
those to be hard.

693
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,590
If you fall into something like
this, then that's not good.

694
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,350

695
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,095
Question.

696
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:36,313
AUDIENCE: So let's say, since
this Not-All-Equal thing--

697
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:38,620
let's say you call
it red and blue.

698
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,364
What if you add green?

699
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:48,829
Then would there be-- would
Not-All-Equal 3SAT be NP-hard,

700
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,730
or would you need
4SAT or something?

701
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,396
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

702
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,580
So what about ternary truth?

703
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,888

704
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:01,349
I-- there might be a
problem on that in the PSET.

705
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:04,970
But in general, you would
have to go through the work

706
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,230
to check which problems.

707
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,910
I think those are
pretty uncommon.

708
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,829
So usually what you do is
if you have a gadget that

709
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,027
can be solved not two
ways, but four ways,

710
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,110
is you call two of them
true and two of them false

711
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,970
and hope they behave
more or less identically.

712
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,349
So that's the most common
answer, practically,

713
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:22,889
to what we do.

714
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,354
But it certainly is plausible
with three different values.

715
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,770
Some of these are
going to be hard

716
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,960
but I don't know which ones.

717
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,661
Hopefully all them, but
you have to be careful.

718
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,119
And definitely the
next theorem I'm

719
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,250
going to talk about--
the dichotomy theorem--

720
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,900
would get more complicated
with three colors.

721
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:50,500

722
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,160
Nice question.

723
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,920

724
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:08,020
So let's do Schaefer's
Dichotomy Theorem.

725
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,770
This is about which versions
of SAT are polynomial

726
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,270
and which versions
are NP-complete.

727
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,470
With the right set up, every
problem you can think of

728
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,480
is either polynomial
or NP-complete.

729
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,760
There's no things in-between.

730
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,940
These are called
NP-intermediate problems.

731
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,890
So it's always going to be
one extreme or the other,

732
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,440
as I'm about to set it up.

733
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
And this theorem is by Schaefer.

734
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,330
And in the very
same paper he proves

735
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,000
Not-All-Equal 3SAT and
1-in-3SAT are hard.

736
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,420
Those are the original proofs.

737
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,740
So it's a great paper.

738
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,690
I have looked at it many times.

739
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,620
It's from 1978.

740
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,719
So long time ago.

741
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,760
But still quite readable.

742
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,120

743
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,320
So I don't know how much-- all
the last problems we've stated

744
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,650
have this property, but
I'll make it explicit again.

745
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,490
That's your formula is going
to be an AND of clauses.

746
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,170
And now we're going to allow
general kinds of clauses.

747
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,000
A clause is just going
to be any relation

748
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,585
on some number of variables.

749
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:17,317

750
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,650
So there won't be any notion
of literal here because you

751
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,100
can put that in the relation.

752
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll call this a general
clause and say relation

753
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,745
on some variables.

754
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:34,580

755
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,720
So relation is
something-- I give you

756
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,900
a set of truth values
for those variables

757
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,280
and will say yes or no.

758
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,857
That's valid or it's invalid.

759
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,440
You can think of a
relation as the set

760
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,690
of all assignments of the
variables that make it true.

761
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,116
But you don't have to
specify that, per se.

762
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:49,490
You just sort of
know what it is.

763
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,290

764
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:52,790
OK.

765
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,280
So I mean, in
particular, it could

766
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,600
be the OR of three
variables, then we get 3SAT.

767
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,470
Or it could be the Not-All-Equal
constraint on three variables,

768
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,150
then it's Not-All-Equal
3SAT, and so on.

769
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,961

770
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,460
OK.

771
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,020
We are going to--
so I guess, sorry.

772
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,200
The relationship should be given
to you as a Boolean formula.

773
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,800
So it could be an OR, or
you can write 1-in-3SAT

774
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,889
as a Boolean formula.

775
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:16,930
It's just little tedious.

776
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,730
You could say, well it could
be this, or it could be this,

777
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,710
or it could be this.

778
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,360
In general, I'm going
to assume that they're

779
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,080
given to you in CNF form.

780
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Sorry, that's redundant.

781
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,510
CNF has "form" in it.

782
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,820
Because any formula
can be made into CNF.

783
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,410
So now CNF is an
AND of ORs, so this

784
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,029
is going to be an AND of what
we might normally call clauses,

785
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:44,570
but we're already
in a clause, so I'm

786
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,820
going to call this subclauses.

787
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,410

788
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,907
Starting to sound like legalese.

789
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:52,740
I made up this word.

790
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,640
It's not in the literature.

791
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,410
So in general, your formula
is an AND of clauses,

792
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,020
each one is just
some relation, which

793
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,640
we're going to think of
as an AND of subclauses.

794
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,848
Of course, it's really just
an AND of all the things.

795
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:06,250
But this is trying
to be general.

796
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,020
Because we're going to have
constraints in the clauses,

797
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,290
in particular.

798
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:18,810
So then claim is SAT-- on
these types of formulas-- so

799
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,500
here's the difference, I guess.

800
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,830
To define the problem, you
specify what kind of relations

801
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,520
that you allow.

802
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,250
So in 3SAT, we say, OK,
so OR of three things.

803
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,100
In CNF SAT, it's an OR
of k things for any k.

804
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,210
In Not-All-Equal 3SAT, it's
not all equal of three things,

805
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,710
and so on.

806
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,970
So we give that up front and
then the decision problem

807
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,960
is well, I have
n variables and I

808
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,764
can combine them with these
clauses however I want.

809
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:51,430
So we need some kind
of infinity, right?

810
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,040
If I gave you a
specific problem,

811
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,000
then it's not going
to be NP-hard.

812
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,810
Like, with these 10
variables, that's

813
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,760
never going to be interesting.

814
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,090
So I give you the notion
of what causes are allowed,

815
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,570
what relations are
permitted, and then I

816
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,890
want to consider the class
of all possible formulas you

817
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,506
can build with
clauses of that type.

818
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:14,880
So you can think of this as
really more of a clause type,

819
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,240
like Not-All-Equal,
just to be precise here.

820
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,160
And then we get
a version of SAT.

821
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:33,590
And it's going to be polynomial
if one of four cases happen.

822
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,540
At least one.

823
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,390
Any one of these
will make it easy.

824
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,500
We have seen almost
all of these.

825
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:45,540
So first one is setting
all variables true

826
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,310
satisfies the formula.

827
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,890
Well not just the formula,
but all formulas of this type.

828
00:39:51,890 --> 00:40:07,395
Or all variables false
satisfies all clauses.

829
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:10,250

830
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:10,750
OK.

831
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,370
This is a statement over all
formulas with this clause type,

832
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:13,869
right?

833
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,660
So, a statement about
the clause types.

834
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,170
And it's one of the issues we
were having with not-exactly-1

835
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,297
3SAT, because there the
clause type allowed everything

836
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,380
to be false and it also
had everything to be true,

837
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,840
so it was doubly bad.

838
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,129
But of course is if you
have clauses where this

839
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:30,670
is true for all
the-- you could allow

840
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,794
different types of clauses.

841
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:34,590
You could have Not-All-Equal
plus 1-in-3SAT, that

842
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,367
will also be hard, of course.

843
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,950
But if all of your clauses have
this property, then of course,

844
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,116
you just globally set the
variables and you're done.

845
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:43,600

846
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,351
OK.

847
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:46,350
That was the first case.

848
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:57,130

849
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,200
All right.

850
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,800
So the next one is that
it could be the subclauses

851
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,105
are all Horn, or all dual Horn.

852
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:18,590

853
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,829
So those are two happy
cases we saw before.

854
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:23,620
I mean, we can think
of the overall problem

855
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,870
as an AND of the clauses,
which are ANDs of subclauses,

856
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,410
so if everything is a
Horn or dual Horn thing,

857
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,340
then we're happy.

858
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:43,070
And next case is the
relations are all 2-CNF.

859
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,810
So this would be the 2SAT case.

860
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,230
If all the relations you're
working with are in 2-CNF,

861
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,855
then when we AND them together,
you still have a 2-CNF formula,

862
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:53,170
so you can solve it by 2SAT.

863
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,140
So these are all
things we've seen.

864
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,060
There's one more
case we haven't seen.

865
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,186
Is there a question?

866
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,158
Yeah.

867
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:04,074
AUDIENCE: Isn't 2SAT just a
subcase of the Horn and dual

868
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:05,449
Horn thing?

869
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:06,990
Because you're always
going to have--

870
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,865
PROFESSOR: It's true.

871
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:11,210
2SAT is a special case of Horn.

872
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,144
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

873
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:15,102
AUDIENCE: You could have
one with two positives

874
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,560
and another one
with two negatives.

875
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,994
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's true.

876
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,502
Yeah.

877
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:20,960
PROFESSOR: Ah,
right, right, right.

878
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,510
So I see.

879
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,720
So 2-CNF, some of the
clauses are going to be Horn

880
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,700
and some of them are
dual Horn, I think.

881
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,770
So it doesn't fall into
this because it's not

882
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,670
all one or the other.

883
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,970
In general, those
combinations are bad.

884
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,467
But 2SAT is always OK.

885
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,050
Good question.

886
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,920

887
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:48,255
OK Last case is
some linear algebra.

888
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:54,940

889
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,400
This is one other
easy case of SAT

890
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
which doesn't come
up very often,

891
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,430
so I didn't write it
as a separate one.

892
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:27,450

893
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,680
So imagine equations like this.

894
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,440
I take some number variables,
I XOR them together and I say,

895
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,690
that should be 0, or similar
thing, I set it equal to 1.

896
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,600
Those are what I would call
linear equation over Zmod2.

897
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,850
Because in Zmod2 -- the finite
field in two elements --

898
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,990
addition becomes XOR and
there's no multiplication here

899
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,910
because it's a linear system.

900
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,330
So we can solve these things
because Z2 is a finite field.

901
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,250
We can use Gaussian
elimination if-- even

902
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,570
if I have a whole bunch
of these equations,

903
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,050
I can solve them all using
Gaussian elimination.

904
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,630
Or determine that
they're unsolvable.

905
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:13,190
So that's another easy case
for SAT to be careful about.

906
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,850
And the theorem is if you
have one of these situations--

907
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,180
so you can't mix these.

908
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,760
If you have one
clause of this type

909
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,080
and another clause of this type,
your problem will be NP-hard.

910
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,490
So in general, you say,
otherwise SAT is NP-hard.

911
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,965

912
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,590
I guess it will
actually be NP-complete

913
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,090
here, the way we've set it up.

914
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,720
Well, assuming the
relations are checkable.

915
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,090
So these are the only cases.

916
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,885
This is an easy case,
this is an easy case,

917
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:48,760
this is an easy case.

918
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,040
It could be that multiple
of these things are true.

919
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,710
Maybe your 2CNF
and your all Horn.

920
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,860
That will also be
polynomial, of course.

921
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,980
But if none of these
individually hold,

922
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,800
then your problem is NP-hard.

923
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,423
Question.

924
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:01,964
AUDIENCE: So how
does this generalize

925
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:04,366
from non-Boolean fields?

926
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,260
I'm sure the last one
is also still true.

927
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,926
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

928
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:09,580
So we can go back to your
question about three colors,

929
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,190
and the answer is I don't know.

930
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,740
As far as I know, there's
no theorem of that type.

931
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,730
But there might be one.

932
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,550
It's been 30 years.

933
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,826
So it wouldn't be surprising.

934
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:20,950
Certainly, you can-- some
of these positive results

935
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,720
will generalize.

936
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,760
But I think even this one
would be a little tricky.

937
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,602
AUDIENCE: So MAX 2SAT
doesn't fall in this?

938
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,310
PROFESSOR: Right.

939
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,735
So here the goal is always to
satisfy all of the clauses.

940
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,360
It's always the AND
of all the clauses.

941
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,960
You could imagine a
MAX 2SAT-like theorem.

942
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,810
My guess is most
problems will be hard.

943
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,080
But as far as I know,
there's no such theorem.

944
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,870
Yeah.

945
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,078
AUDIENCE: Is there any way
to understand this theorem

946
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:51,160
as making a geometric statement
about the relation being convex

947
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,330
and hypercube or something?

948
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,830
Like, is there any
sort of convexity

949
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,870
property encoded in this?

950
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:58,870
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

951
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,540
I would guess no.

952
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,310
I know there is a
more modern take

953
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,709
on this that is more algebraic.

954
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,750
So it's more like, if you
start with these things

955
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,124
and you can build
up in this way,

956
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,960
anything you can
build up in this way

957
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,680
are the polynomial
solvable versions of SAT.

958
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,436
Anything you can't build
up in this way is NP-hard.

959
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:19,810
So if you're interested in
that, check the Wikipedia page

960
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,142
for Schaefer's
Dichotomy Theorem.

961
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,350
But I don't think there's
a geometric interpretation.

962
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,516
This one, obviously, has a
geometric interpretation.

963
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:31,080
But I think the others
not, would be my guess.

964
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,320
Yeah.

965
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,820
AUDIENCE: So does
this say something

966
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,660
about the complexity of
recognizing the clauses if you

967
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,150
interpret them as a language?

968
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,460
PROFESSOR: If I give
you the formula that

969
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,620
specifies the types
of clauses, can you

970
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,160
determine whether any
of these is the case.

971
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,090
I would guess yes, but I
don't know of such a theorem.

972
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,100
So another good question.

973
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,530
So many questions
to think about here.

974
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,860
It's definitely not
explicitly mentioned,

975
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,470
that I saw, in the
Schaefer paper.

976
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,990
But it's been around for
a while so people may

977
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,501
have thought about that more.

978
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:07,000
It definitely can
be a little tricky

979
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,410
to check which things are
of this type, practically.

980
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,020
So it would be nice if
there was an algorithm.

981
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,920
I would say-- so again,
practically speaking,

982
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,780
there was one hardness proof I
was trying to generate gadgets

983
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,800
computationally.

984
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,570
So just enumerate
all possible gadgets

985
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,470
of a certain size
for my problem,

986
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,370
and then see what formula
they were representing.

987
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,060
And then we would
take that formula,

988
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,960
do a Karnaugh map -- if you've
ever done digital logic stuff --

989
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,510
and then from that, you
get a nice, minimal form.

990
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,060
And then we would-- usually
we could just look at the map

991
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,760
and say, oh, that's
just equals, or that's

992
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,930
not equals or something.

993
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,990
We were hoping for-- we
were dreaming for-- one

994
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,610
of these things or 3SAT.

995
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,980
We never got the
gadget we wanted.

996
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,150
So I think, with a Karnaugh
map, you could do this.

997
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,350
But that's exponential time.

998
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

999
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,119
PROFESSOR: So I
don't know for sure.

1000
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,910
I should probably check
the algebraic view.

1001
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,770
That might--

1002
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,754
AUDIENCE: That's a
clever approach though.

1003
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:12,420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1004
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,820
AUDIENCE: To do things
computationally.

1005
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,280
PROFESSOR: It's
definitely helpful.

1006
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,980
Because of course,
computationally, you

1007
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,360
can only look at small gadgets.

1008
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,460
But hopefully there is a small
gadget and then a nice proof.

1009
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,616
So why do the hard work of
generating them yourself when

1010
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:25,990
the computer could
do it for you?

1011
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,710
It doesn't work
for all problems.

1012
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,230
Your problems need to
be locally isolatable.

1013
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,770
To not worry about
the big picture.

1014
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,690
Other questions?

1015
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,250
Cool.

1016
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,640
Well that's all the versions
of SAT you need to know.

1017
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,170
Because here we have the
universality theorem.

1018
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,550
There will be another
one or two that we

1019
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,380
bump into but these are the
things you should all know.

1020
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,100
It's really helpful
when doing a proof

1021
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,770
to not have to worry about
which version 3SAT you even

1022
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,516
are going to use, and just know
that these are all out here.

1023
00:48:58,516 --> 00:49:00,890
So that when you find a gadget
that happens to match one,

1024
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,306
and then you say,
oh, well I meant

1025
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,221
to do a reduction from
Not-All-Equal 3SAT.

1026
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,970
That's why I wanted
to tell you all these,

1027
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,200
although I know it's a lot
to take in all at once.

1028
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,475
Let's do some
reductions, finally.

1029
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:20,640

1030
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,910
NP-hardcore time.

1031
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:31,310
So the first one, I had
actually never seen before,

1032
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,980
but it's in Schaefer's paper.

1033
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,205
So I thought it'd
be fun to cover.

1034
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,830

1035
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,740
Here's a problem,
which is NP-hard,

1036
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,160
and we will actually
prove this one NP-hard.

1037
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,640
2-colorable perfect matching.

1038
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,280

1039
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,970
Let's say you're given a
planar 3-regular graph,

1040
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,430
every vertex has degree 3.

1041
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:01,780

1042
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,050
And what you'd like to do is
2-color the vertices, a red

1043
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:26,166
and blue, such that every
vertex has exactly one

1044
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:27,290
neighbor of the same color.

1045
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:37,150

1046
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,650
OK.

1047
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:43,390
So if you look at a vertex
and it has three neighbors,

1048
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,980
then-- let's say we
color this guy red,

1049
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,010
there should be exactly
one neighbor that's red.

1050
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,166
And so you can think of
this edge as being red,

1051
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,290
and then the red edges will
form a perfect matching

1052
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,179
in the graph.

1053
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:54,720
Every vertex will
be incident to

1054
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,429
exactly one edge.

1055
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,220
So that's the 2-colorable
perfect matching.

1056
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,560
It's kind of-- well, sorry.

1057
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,300
The red edges form perfect
matching on the red nodes,

1058
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,870
and the black-- or
the white edges,

1059
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,920
I guess-- form a perfect
matching on the white nodes,

1060
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,350
black nodes, whatever.

1061
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,770
So it's like two
perfect matchings,

1062
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,410
one in each color class.

1063
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,830
So this is a nice problem.

1064
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,670
You can think of it
as SAT, in a sense.

1065
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,210
It's, again, just a local
constraint on the nodes.

1066
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,007

1067
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:30,340
And so you can think of this
as being a clause involving

1068
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,280
those four guys.

1069
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,260
I think, unless I
did something wrong,

1070
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,280
you can think of it
as 2-in-4SAT,

1071
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,340
or a special version
of 2-in-4SAT.

1072
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,585
Because-- is that right?

1073
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:46,540
Yeah.

1074
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,210
So let's say red is true.

1075
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,447
So what we're saying
is if this guy is true,

1076
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,530
among these four nodes
there should be exactly one

1077
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,470
other one that is red.

1078
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,190
On the other hand,
if this is black,

1079
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,130
there should be exactly
one of them that is black.

1080
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,960
And so the other
two should be red.

1081
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,500
So in all cases, it's exactly
two in four of them are red.

1082
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,370
And it's symmetric between red
and black, so that seems good.

1083
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,590
So this is a special
case of 2-in-4SAT.

1084
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,270
In case you were wondering
whether 2-in-4SAT is hard,

1085
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,340
here it is.

1086
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:23,265
And I have the original
reduction by Schaefer here.

1087
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,420
Do I have any notes?

1088
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,090
No, that would be too easy.

1089
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:32,620
So here's a gadget and
here's another gadget,

1090
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,760
and then they're
pasted together.

1091
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,560
And I should
mention-- so Schaefer

1092
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,855
claims that if you have
a planar 3-regular graph,

1093
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,730
this problem is hard.

1094
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,220
But he doesn't prove it.

1095
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,910
He just proves it
for general graphs,

1096
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,460
so I'm only going to prove
it for general graphs.

1097
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,370
Maybe we can think about
planar 3-regular case,

1098
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,340
but not right here.

1099
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,580
So this will just make a graph
instance to that problem.

1100
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,180
So this gadget,
this is a K4 on--

1101
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,490
and we're only
distinguishing x, y, and z.

1102
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,370
And it has to
form-- there's going

1103
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,930
to be one red edge
and one black edge.

1104
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,630
So maybe like this,
and like this.

1105
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,970
Or like this, or like this.

1106
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,950
It's going to be a rotation
of one of those assignments.

1107
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,970
So I believe the
claim is x, y, and z,

1108
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,770
just looking at
those three vertices,

1109
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,890
should be not-all-equal.

1110
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:24,390
OK?

1111
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,090
If two of them are red,
by symmetry-- there's

1112
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,410
lots of rotational symmetry
here-- so maybe two of them

1113
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,800
are red and one is black.

1114
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Then this guy can be set
black and you're happy.

1115
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,930
It's actually forced for
that guy to be black.

1116
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,500
If two of them are black,
then these two must be red.

1117
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,570
And if all three of these
are black, you're toast.

1118
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,710
Because you should
have two of each.

1119
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:48,040
And if all three of them
are red, you're in trouble.

1120
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,890
So this is a not-all-equal
clause gadget for this problem.

1121
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,290
So we're going to reduce
from Not-All-Equal 3SAT

1122
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,030
to 2-colorable perfect matching.

1123
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,050
So we're representing a
Not-All-Equal clause like this.

1124
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:10,650
And now what we need is the
ability to copy data, right?

1125
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,070
So these are three variables
that-- at the moment, yeah,

1126
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,580
they can be red or blue.

1127
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,730
But what we need
is that the same x_i

1128
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,330
can appear in multiple clauses.

1129
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,779
Because we have a
bipartite graph.

1130
00:54:19,779 --> 00:54:21,820
If every variable appeared
in only in one clause,

1131
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,740
the problem would
be really easy.

1132
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,990
So that's what this gadget does.

1133
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,080
The claim is this
gadget copies a value.

1134
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,650
And this, I think, requires--
so it says that these two

1135
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,300
guys must have the same color.

1136
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,160
And so what you do
is you just have--

1137
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,920
for each Not-All-Equal
clause-- you

1138
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,940
have one of these
Not-All-Equal gadgets.

1139
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,180
And then whenever you
have two variables

1140
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,080
that are supposed to be the
same thing here, it's x and x.

1141
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,177
In our terminology, x_i and x_i.

1142
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:51,510
Then you're just going to
connect them with this gadget.

1143
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,630
And that will force
them to be equal.

1144
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,180
Or over here we have y and y.

1145
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,560
So r here is Not-All-Equal.

1146
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,490
In our terminology, it'd
be NAE(x,x,y) and NAE(y,z,u).

1147
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:05,696
This would represent
that formula.

1148
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:08,070
So the thing to check, which
I will leave as an exercise,

1149
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,665
because it seems-- at least,
I couldn't find a clean way

1150
00:55:11,665 --> 00:55:12,165
to do it.

1151
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:13,414
It seems a little bit tedious.

1152
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:18,360
That this forces equality
between the two ends,

1153
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,015
not providing any
other constraints.

1154
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:23,010

1155
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,016
So that was a simple proof.

1156
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:27,520
One of few simple proofs.

1157
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,660
Still some cases to check.

1158
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,949
Yeah.

1159
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,865
AUDIENCE: Wait, you said
those general graphs,

1160
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:33,020
they don't have to be
3-regular?

1161
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,728
PROFESSOR: Right.

1162
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:36,500
This is general graphs.

1163
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,890
So you might say, what about
planar 3-regular graphs?

1164
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:45,230
Planar Not-All-Equal 3SAT--
when this graph is planar--

1165
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,400
when the bipartite graph
is planar-- it's actually

1166
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,430
easy to solve, polynomial.

1167
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,890
So you can't reduce from
planar Not-All-Equal 3SAT

1168
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,520
because it's easy.

1169
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,680
But I would guess that
in this situation--

1170
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,970
and we just proved this
is a more general problem

1171
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,900
than Not-All-Equal
3SAT-- what we

1172
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,320
would need at this point
is a crossover gadget.

1173
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,310
So that when-- and
this thing is going

1174
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,980
to end up with crossings--
if there's a gadget that just

1175
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,430
communicates the information
across the crossover,

1176
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,020
without any other
constraints, then

1177
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,270
we can just plug that in and
get rid of all crossings.

1178
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,540
Then we have a planar graph
and that would prove this part.

1179
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,530
And then the other part is that
we have high degree nodes here.

1180
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,464
And so I'm guessing
Schaefer had in mind

1181
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,130
the gadget that takes
a high degree node

1182
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,860
and splits it up into lots of
little lower degree nodes--

1183
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,170
degree 3 nodes-- that
simulates the same effect.

1184
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,980
But I don't know either gadget.

1185
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,240
But that would be my
guess on how to-- that

1186
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,740
would be the obvious
approach of how

1187
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,354
to proceed to get that theorem.

1188
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:38,854
Yeah.

1189
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,270
AUDIENCE: The other
gadget is just

1190
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,810
1(b) split into
degree 3 copies connected

1191
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,467
by that gadget.

1192
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:48,050
PROFESSOR: OK.

1193
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,040
Good.

1194
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,840
One gadget down.

1195
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,048
Now we just need a crossover.

1196
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:53,394

1197
00:56:53,394 --> 00:56:54,060
Other questions?

1198
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,950

1199
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,240
All right.

1200
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,240
I want to talk about two
families of problems--

1201
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,560
a proof hardness for two
families of problems-- next.

1202
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,930
One is called pushing blocks.

1203
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,210
These come up in lots of
different video games.

1204
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,430
One of the first, I
think, is called Sokoban.

1205
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,260
This goes back to 1984 and this
is, I believe, the original CGA

1206
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,910
graphics for Sokoban.

1207
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,040
And so you may have
played Sokoban.

1208
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,480
I think it's in Emacs.

1209
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,580
It's all over the place.

1210
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,990
Tons of implementations on it.

1211
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,910
You are at a warehouseman, that
is what sokoban means literally

1212
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,980
in Japanese.

1213
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,080
And you have these boxes.

1214
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,150
They're all one by one boxes.

1215
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:37,941
You are one by one.

1216
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:40,550
There are some bricks
which cannot be moved.

1217
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,080
You have some target
locations and your poor job

1218
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,590
is to move all these boxes
into the target locations.

1219
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,340
Or rather, every
target location must

1220
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,450
be covered by exactly one box.

1221
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,012
Boxes can't overlap each
other, you can push a box,

1222
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,470
but you can only
push one at a time

1223
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,770
because you're not that strong.

1224
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:58,430
So you could not, for
example, push left here.

1225
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,100
But in general, your inputs
are up, down, left, and right.

1226
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,460
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right.

1227
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,119
And you can only push
one block at a time.

1228
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,660
So if you push a
block into a corner,

1229
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,370
it's never going to move again.

1230
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,170
So often you have to hit reset.

1231
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,770
There's a lot of
ways to get stuck.

1232
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,900
But this is a solvable instance.

1233
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,370
I think it's level five
in the original game.

1234
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:23,292
So this got started a
huge family of problems.

1235
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:24,750
There are tons of
other video games

1236
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,400
that have pushing
blocks problems.

1237
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,480
This is one, in Legend of
Zelda: Minish Cap, which I think

1238
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,470
is a Gameboy Advance game.

1239
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,220
It's been a while since
I played this one.

1240
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,030
But here is a level
where you have--

1241
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,980
it's in perspective
a little bit,

1242
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,190
but this is really a 2D problem.

1243
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,430
Everything is one by one.

1244
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,730
Believe me.

1245
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,690
You have one by one blocks.

1246
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,070
You're on ice.

1247
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,620
So if you ever push a
block, it will slide off

1248
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,930
to infinity unless it hits
something else, like a block.

1249
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,021
And your goal is to
get a block here.

1250
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:57,520
OK?

1251
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,680
Anyone see how to do it?

1252
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,293

1253
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:02,793
AUDIENCE: It's like
Ricochet Robots.

1254
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:03,250
AUDIENCE: Can you
walk without sliding?

1255
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,540
PROFESSOR: It's a lot
like Ricochet Robots.

1256
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,390
Yeah.

1257
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,500
You can walk wherever you want.

1258
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,440
There is no block.

1259
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,860
So there's lots of free
space in this case.

1260
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:16,650
So you can push this guy down
and then push it over and then

1261
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,310
push it up.

1262
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,970
It's actually not that hard.

1263
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:20,636
At some point I was
thinking, well maybe

1264
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:23,670
I should stack up three
here so it ends up-- but no.

1265
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:28,062
It's just three pushes
and you're done.

1266
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:30,520
And if you watch the YouTube
video that's linked from this,

1267
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,870
you'll see him spend
like 30 minutes

1268
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,700
until he finds the
right solution.

1269
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,241
In the game, it's frustrating
because once you push them off,

1270
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,550
they disappear and you have
to leave and come back.

1271
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,510
Anyway.

1272
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:45,730
So out of all these games,
we've defined a bunch of models.

1273
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,490
Here's one aspect of the model.

1274
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,250
So we have the
fixed blocks, which

1275
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,990
are in red, the movable
blocks, which are in cyan here,

1276
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,220
and the robot is blue.

1277
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,150
Everything's one by one.

1278
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:01,710
And in one model, which we call
Push, when you push a block,

1279
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,380
it moves one step.

1280
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,580
That's the normal model.

1281
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,760
And that's like Sokoban.

1282
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,110
And I'll talk about
the two in a second.

1283
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,300
In PushPush-- this is
like the on-ice version.

1284
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,240
So you're not on ice.

1285
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,460
You can still kind of
move and then kind of

1286
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,700
counteract physics and
just move one step.

1287
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,930
But the blocks, they'll just fly
off until they hit something.

1288
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:26,490
So here, this block will
fly until it goes there.

1289
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,690
In PushPushPush,
everything is so slippery

1290
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,520
that if you hit a block and
it hits another block that's

1291
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,020
movable, they will all
just keep going until they

1292
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,296
hit an immovable block.

1293
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,059
AUDIENCE: But you don't slip.

1294
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:42,350
PROFESSOR: You still don't
slip in any of these models.

1295
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,099
So there's another
version where you slip,

1296
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,930
which has not been
considered so much.

1297
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,850
Although Ricochet Robots
has been considered

1298
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,290
and that's in that genre.

1299
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:49,790
Yeah?

1300
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:53,592
AUDIENCE: Is there a model
where the block you first pushed

1301
01:00:53,592 --> 01:00:55,550
stops and transfers its
momentum to the other--

1302
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,350
PROFESSOR: Oh, cool.

1303
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:56,680
Yeah.

1304
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,690
Conservation momentum.

1305
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,200
So this one hits then
the next one goes.

1306
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,909
That's probably--

1307
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:01,866
AUDIENCE: PushStopPush.

1308
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,960
PROFESSOR: PushStopPush.

1309
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,100
I would guess that's also
hard because this ends up

1310
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,395
being the same proof.

1311
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:08,610
I'm guessing that works,
but we would need to check.

1312
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,010
That's a good-- yeah.

1313
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:14,030
The push-- push ricochet push.

1314
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,530
OK.

1315
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,650
One other thing here
is the number two.

1316
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,830
You'll notice only
two blocks are moving.

1317
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,080
And normally here, two is
the strength of the robot,

1318
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,072
meaning if there are
up to two in a row,

1319
01:01:24,072 --> 01:01:26,530
you can push two blocks, but
once there are three in a row,

1320
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,470
you can't push at all.

1321
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,350
The idea here is the
same thing happens.

1322
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,970
So they're just too heavy.

1323
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:34,120
After you get up
to three of them,

1324
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,150
then they'll stop sliding.

1325
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,300
And same with PushPushPush.

1326
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,620
AUDIENCE: So Sokoban
is actually Push-1.

1327
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,480
PROFESSOR: Sokoban
is like Push-1.

1328
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,970
It's a little bit
more complicated,

1329
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,390
as illustrated in this table.

1330
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:52,800
So Sokoban is here and you can
only push one block at a time.

1331
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,929
There are fixed blocks.

1332
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:55,970
And in general, the models
that have fixed blocks

1333
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:59,070
are highlighted in pink here.

1334
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:02,380
The slide thing is trying
to capture whether it just

1335
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:06,000
moves one step or all the
way until it can't anymore.

1336
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,677
That's the max.

1337
01:02:06,677 --> 01:02:08,510
And there's only a
couple of slide versions.

1338
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:11,020
I haven't put PushPushPush
here because that

1339
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,960
would be the only difference--
is what max means.

1340
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,200
But everything else
you just move one step.

1341
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,550
Then the other issue
is, what is the goal?

1342
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,740
I mentioned in Sokoban you
have to cover every storage

1343
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,100
space with a box.

1344
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,760
That is the only problem with
that flavor, in this list

1345
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,440
anyway.

1346
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,210
All the ones that
are called Push--

1347
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,390
the goal is just to get
the robot to a destination,

1348
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,850
like in Mario or
Zelda or something.

1349
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:42,030
So that's the difference
between Sokoban and Push-1.

1350
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:46,490
Well Push-1F, I suppose,
is pushing one thing

1351
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,720
at a time with fixed blocks.

1352
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,890
That's identical to Sokoban
except for this issue of what

1353
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:52,520
the goal is.

1354
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,981
Either just to get from
s to t-- the robot--

1355
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:57,355
or to get all the blocks into
a particular configuration.

1356
01:02:57,355 --> 01:03:00,690

1357
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,450
OK.

1358
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,740
Well there are some
other things here.

1359
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,660
We've talked about Push-k.

1360
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,370
Push-* is when k is infinity.

1361
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,780
So when you push, you can--
your arbitrary strength--

1362
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,630
you can push as many blocks
in a row as you want.

1363
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,340
PushPush-k, PushPush-*, then.

1364
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,810
We've talked about F. F is
when you have fixed blocks.

1365
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:23,800
Push-1F, Push-kF,
and Push-*F.

1366
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,950
And then there's one
other variation here

1367
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,790
that's been considered,
which is the X.

1368
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:30,520
This is when the path
that the robot takes

1369
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,720
must not cross itself--
must not revisit a square.

1370
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,240
This is-- there a
lot of video games

1371
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,630
where after you leave a
square, that square disappears.

1372
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:42,470
It falls down into the
abyss and so you're scared.

1373
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,850
So to represent
those games-- there's

1374
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,170
another reason we did that, but
I'll get to that in a moment--

1375
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:51,141
there's Push-kX
and Push-*X.

1376
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,640
OK.

1377
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,973
Now let's talk about complexity.

1378
01:03:52,973 --> 01:03:55,440
That's the right
two columns here.

1379
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,520
The reference and
the complexity.

1380
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,550
So all of these
problems are NP-hard.

1381
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,050
OK?

1382
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,560
But there's this
issue-- are they in NP

1383
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,141
or are they PSPACE-Complete?

1384
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:07,640
Question.

1385
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,306
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

1386
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:10,010
What did you say
a fixed block is?

1387
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,880
PROFESSOR: A fixed block is a
block that cannot be pushed.

1388
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,470
So it's just glued
to the ground.

1389
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,494
AUDIENCE: So this is
just whether or not

1390
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:16,520
there are some blocks
that are fixed.

1391
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,228
PROFESSOR: Right.

1392
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,660
In these problems, this
is a more general version

1393
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,960
than this game.

1394
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,820
Here, you allow some blocks
to be specified as fixed.

1395
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,890
Here, everything is
potentially movable.

1396
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,640
Although if you have
more than k in a row,

1397
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,770
it's like a fixed block.

1398
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:31,060
If you have a
k+1 by k+1 block,

1399
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,590
that's fixed, effectively.

1400
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:36,140
But you have a
resolution issue that you

1401
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,740
can't make tiny fixed
blocks in this model.

1402
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,190
And in this model there are
no fixed blocks whatsoever.

1403
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,380
But here you can specify
some of them are fixed.

1404
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,210

1405
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:46,960
A lot of versions.

1406
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,190
AUDIENCE: So push-star
has a boundary?

1407
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,550
Otherwise you could just--

1408
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,971
PROFESSOR: Push-star does
live in a rectangular box.

1409
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:52,470
Yeah.

1410
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,314
That is the one.

1411
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:54,230
AUDIENCE: Is it fixed?

1412
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:58,850
PROFESSOR: You could think of
that as fixed blocks or not.

1413
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,450
If nothing is fixed, then you
can just walk off to infinity,

1414
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,460
move all the blocks
away and then come back

1415
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,543
and find your destination.

1416
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:05,712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1417
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:06,420
PROFESSOR: Right.

1418
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,820
So they're all NP-hard.

1419
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,680
There's a few that are
known to be PSPACE-Complete.

1420
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,960
PushPush, with a fixed
strength, is PSPACE-Complete.

1421
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,640
Or with fixed blocks, I think,
should also be PSPACE-Complete.

1422
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,290
That's not written here.

1423
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,650
But PushPush-*, all
we know is NP-hardness.

1424
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,200

1425
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,450
Push-kF, where k is at least 2,
is known to be PSPACE-Complete.

1426
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:39,560
But Push-1F or Push-2,
without the F, are both open.

1427
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,120
And the reason we
were interested

1428
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,850
in a non-crossing path is that
forces the problem to be in NP.

1429
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,474
Because then you know
the solution path

1430
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:47,530
has polynomial length.

1431
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,560
You can visit each
square at most once.

1432
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,470
So the hard part
here was to prove

1433
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,030
that it's still NP-hard,
even with non-crossing paths.

1434
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,879
We won't try to
prove that today.

1435
01:05:55,879 --> 01:05:58,170
So those, we actually have
tight bounds of NP-complete.

1436
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,370
And Sokoban-- there's a
relatively old result--

1437
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,620
1998-- that it's
PSPACE-Complete.

1438
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,120
OK.

1439
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,350
Let's do some reductions.

1440
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:08,270
So this first reduction
is amazingly cool.

1441
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,520
It's by Michael Hoffman, 2000.

1442
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,940
This is Push-* with
a rectangular box.

1443
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,440
OK.

1444
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,600
So you're here.

1445
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,410
The outlined regions
are the blank space.

1446
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,590
Everything else is
filled with a block.

1447
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,770
But every block
is movable and you

1448
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,460
can push arbitrarily strongly.

1449
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,750
So this is going
to be variables.

1450
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,740
You're going to make
some choices here.

1451
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,530
These are the connections
between variables and clauses.

1452
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,780
This is a bipartite
graph encoded

1453
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,170
in binary in the obvious way.

1454
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,470
There's variables
here, clauses here.

1455
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:42,120
There's a hole exactly when that
literal appears in that clause.

1456
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:42,620
OK?

1457
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,970
There's actually two rows
per variable, the true

1458
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,440
and the false.

1459
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,450
And then there's this gadget
here to connect the things.

1460
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,950
And then these are
the clauses where

1461
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,200
we're going to check that
they were all set correctly.

1462
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,290
So let's go through it.

1463
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,540
This is the schematic
diagram of what I just said.

1464
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,165
We're going to start here
in the variable block

1465
01:06:58,165 --> 01:06:59,790
and walk through each
of the variables.

1466
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,140
Here's what the
variables look like.

1467
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,330
You have two rows, the x_i row
and the x_i-complement row.

1468
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:08,769
That's another way
to write NOT x_i.

1469
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:10,810
And you're going to count,
how many times does x_i

1470
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,090
appear in any clauses?

1471
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,590
In the positive
form, negative form.

1472
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,594
That's called n_i and n_i-bar.

1473
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:17,510
And you're going to
measure out these lengths.

1474
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,870
You can negate variables to
make sure that n_i is always

1475
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,630
bigger than n_i-bar.

1476
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,950
So do that.

1477
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,786
So in this case, n_i is this
big, n_i-bar is this big.

1478
01:07:25,786 --> 01:07:26,410
Measure it out.

1479
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,451
This is your blank space.

1480
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:29,740
And what you're allowed--
what we will show you

1481
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,380
you're allowed to do--
is either move up here

1482
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,080
and move all the way
over here and then up.

1483
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,300
Or to move here and all
the way over and then up.

1484
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,142
And this star is so that the
one block that's here could fit.

1485
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,600
And then you can
go over to this x.

1486
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,724
In general, in these gadgets,
the x is your target.

1487
01:07:45,724 --> 01:07:46,826
x marks the spot.

1488
01:07:46,826 --> 01:07:47,520
All right?

1489
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,840
For the gadget.

1490
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,720
And then there's a
global x, which will

1491
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,810
be at the end of the clauses.

1492
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:54,900
So what does this do?

1493
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,049
Well if you think about
this connection block--

1494
01:07:57,049 --> 01:07:59,129
this is the bipartite
graph encoded

1495
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:03,230
as a matrix-- the number
of blank spaces over here

1496
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,481
is exactly n_i.

1497
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:09,497
So this is why, after you push
n_i steps or n_i-bar steps,

1498
01:08:09,497 --> 01:08:10,330
you'll have to stop.

1499
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,605
Because there are no blank
spaces to the right of you.

1500
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:14,230
Then the only thing
you can do is go up

1501
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,063
because there are no
blank spaces below you.

1502
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:19,250
So in general, these gadgets are
super tight because above you

1503
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,379
there's nothing.

1504
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:21,200
It's all blocks.

1505
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,159
And below you and left
of you, it's all blocks.

1506
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:24,283
There's nothing you can do.

1507
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:25,969
You put the next
variable gadget here,

1508
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:28,379
so then that remains true.

1509
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:29,839
In your row, and
in your columns,

1510
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,880
you're completely packed.

1511
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,530
So the only choice you have
is to do this or to do this.

1512
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:38,750
And you will fill the
row that you choose.

1513
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,633
Exactly.

1514
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:40,420
OK?

1515
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,784
So that's the variable gadget.

1516
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,410
AUDIENCE: What prevents
you from choosing both?

1517
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,049
PROFESSOR: You
could choose both.

1518
01:08:46,049 --> 01:08:48,850
Or you could do a little bit
of one and then do the other.

1519
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:49,350
That's true.

1520
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:51,433
But as we'll see, that
only makes your life worse.

1521
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:52,154
AUDIENCE: OK.

1522
01:08:52,154 --> 01:08:52,820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1523
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,580
Good question.

1524
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,719
So next, we enter
the bridge gadget,

1525
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,370
which is these two pictures
and it looks like this.

1526
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,460
This is basically a
locking mechanism.

1527
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,190
So you start here-- I'll just
tell you're supposed to do.

1528
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,780
You walk over through
this blank space,

1529
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:12,670
then you push all of
these things down to here.

1530
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:16,370
So this basically prevents
you from going back

1531
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,469
to where you were.

1532
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:19,250
So you push all that down.

1533
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:24,440
And then you go over here
and you tunnel down--

1534
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,770
so I think you're moving
these blocks over to here.

1535
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,469
That's another kind of lock.

1536
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:32,320
And then you're pushing
this stuff down to here.

1537
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,180
And then you get there.

1538
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,090
So when all is said and
done, this will be down here,

1539
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,580
this will be down here,
this will be over here.

1540
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,050
And so when you're in
the clause block-- again,

1541
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,290
you have full rows to your
left, full columns above you.

1542
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,760
So there's nothing-- you can't
go up and you can't go left.

1543
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,280
That's the purpose
of this gadget--

1544
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,140
is to connect this
thing to this thing.

1545
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,010
If there was a teleporter,
it would be much easier.

1546
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,551
We could just leave
these all filled.

1547
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:58,690
But we want to get up to here,
but make sure this is all

1548
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,000
filled at the end.

1549
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,450
So that's the sole
purpose of this gadget.

1550
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:02,950
OK.

1551
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,736
Now a clause.

1552
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:08,310
How do we do a clause again?

1553
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,240
So you have-- there's
three spaces here

1554
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,160
because this is 3SAT.

1555
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,280
You can move down one here,
and then move over two.

1556
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,990
These two blocks go here.

1557
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,540
And then you can get to the x.

1558
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,950
Or you can go down here
and over and get to the x.

1559
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,230
Or you can go here
and down, over.

1560
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,806
And this is possible if
there's a hole below you.

1561
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:27,680
This is possible if
there's a hole below you,

1562
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,721
and this is possible if
there's a hole below you.

1563
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:31,810
These are aligned
with these things.

1564
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,400
So with exact-- I
didn't quite align them,

1565
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,150
but these three columns
are these three columns.

1566
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,390
And if one of these
is unfilled, you'll

1567
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:42,920
be able to get
from here to here.

1568
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,430
If they're all
filled, you won't.

1569
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,790
Because it will be full
columns all the way down.

1570
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,470

1571
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:54,490
So that's a clause
gadget because things

1572
01:10:54,490 --> 01:11:00,400
were filled when you chose
that thing to be-- maybe

1573
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,055
I-- did I get it backwards?

1574
01:11:02,055 --> 01:11:04,420
AUDIENCE: So you're really
choosing the opposite.

1575
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,128
PROFESSOR: Right.

1576
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:09,126
You're choosing the
thing to be not true

1577
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:11,250
and leaving the other one
to be as true as possible

1578
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,360
by not pushing it.

1579
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,620
So it leaves the hole so
that later you can traverse--

1580
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,750
AUDIENCE: So that's why you
wouldn't want to choose both.

1581
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,950
PROFESSOR: Right.

1582
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,500
If you chose both, that
would be like making them

1583
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,875
both of them not
true, and so you

1584
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,290
don't get any of the benefits.

1585
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,620
OK?

1586
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,080
That's Push-*.

1587
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,580
Cool?

1588
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:31,240

1589
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,040
OK.

1590
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,610
Let's do PushPush-1 in 3D.

1591
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,930
This is really easy.

1592
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:40,340
This is almost like the
Super Mario Brothers proof.

1593
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:44,580
So it's just old drawing style.

1594
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,330
And we've drawn sort
of the dual graphs,

1595
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:49,290
so these paths are
little width-1 tunnels

1596
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,684
that you can walk down.

1597
01:11:50,684 --> 01:11:53,350
So you start up here and you can
either push this thing this way

1598
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,810
or this way.

1599
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,310
And so you're choosing which
way you'll be able to traverse.

1600
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,280
Either you can go the true
way or the false way--

1601
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,456
the opposite of wherever
you push that block.

1602
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:04,080
And so that cuts off
one of the things.

1603
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,100
Then that path is going to be
connected to all of the clauses

1604
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,320
that it satisfies.

1605
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,315
That that literal
choice satisfies.

1606
01:12:10,315 --> 01:12:11,940
Then there's this
gadget to prevent you

1607
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,120
from wrapping around
to the other side.

1608
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,999
Whichever one you come down, you
will block off the other path.

1609
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:20,040
And then you do that again
for the next variable,

1610
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,248
the next variable, and so on.

1611
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:23,260
At the end of the
last variable, you

1612
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,800
run through all the clauses.

1613
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,000
So how do the clauses work?

1614
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,790
Very simple.

1615
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:32,130
If any of the literals
that satisfy the clause

1616
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:35,720
were visitable, then you
could push this block over.

1617
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,512
And then later, when
you visit the clause--

1618
01:12:37,512 --> 01:12:39,053
at the end, when
you visit the clause

1619
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:41,120
and try to traverse it--
if there's nothing here

1620
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,526
when you push this
block down, it

1621
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:43,900
will go all the
way to the bottom

1622
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,980
and you're trapped, never to get
to the finish line down here.

1623
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,100
But if at least one of these was
in, then it will block this guy

1624
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,930
and you can-- if that's
true for all the clauses--

1625
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,700
then you can get
to the destination.

1626
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,740
So these are just
clause checking.

1627
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:03,609
And that's a very
straightforward 3SAT proof.

1628
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,650
In fact, the previous
proof is based on this one.

1629
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,877
And the next proof
is based on this one.

1630
01:13:07,877 --> 01:13:09,960
And the Nintendo proofs
are all based on this one.

1631
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,606
This is sort of the prototype.

1632
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:13,105
Yeah.

1633
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,146
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
crossover gadget that--

1634
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:16,400
PROFESSOR: So this is 3D.

1635
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,108
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.

1636
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:19,010
PROFESSOR: So
there's no crossover.

1637
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:21,010
But in 2D, we want
to get a crossover.

1638
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:23,250
So here's how we do 2D.

1639
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,130
And this will work for
both Push and Push-1-- Push

1640
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,500
and PushPush.

1641
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
The only place we're
using PushPush

1642
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,750
was this clause gadget, so let's
first get rid of that aspect.

1643
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,261
So here's something
called a lock,

1644
01:13:35,261 --> 01:13:37,510
and you're going to have to
believe a little bit here.

1645
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:40,130

1646
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,140
Your goal, let's say,
is to get from a to b.

1647
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:49,130
And this is what happens if you
try to go from a to b directly.

1648
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:51,010
There isn't much that
you can move-- well,

1649
01:13:51,010 --> 01:14:00,000
you can maybe move I down, J
left, and like this, but-- yes.

1650
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,280
You can move I down, J left, E
down, F left, B down, but not C

1651
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,594
left, because D is in the way.

1652
01:14:11,594 --> 01:14:12,094
OK?

1653
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:15,270

1654
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,830
So you can't get from a to b.

1655
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:22,849
But if you visit from u, and you
push this block out of the way,

1656
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:24,890
then you'd come back
through a, then you can do--

1657
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:25,690
AUDIENCE: Push them over.

1658
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,148
PROFESSOR: You can
do these things.

1659
01:14:27,148 --> 01:14:27,990
Push them all over.

1660
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,270
And then you have
room to push C over,

1661
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:33,150
and then A can go all the
way down, and you're through.

1662
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:36,380
So this unlocks the lock.

1663
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,763
Then allowing a to b
traversal later.

1664
01:14:38,763 --> 01:14:40,262
AUDIENCE: And going
backwards from v

1665
01:14:40,262 --> 01:14:42,140
to u would lock it again?

1666
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:42,880
PROFESSOR: No.

1667
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,220
This is not a reversible gadget.

1668
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,100
It only works once.

1669
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,084
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1670
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,250
PROFESSOR: You can't
un-unlock.

1671
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,030
Once L's down, it's
permanently there.

1672
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:53,870

1673
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,360
So now we're going to use
this in a clause as follows.

1674
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,860
So here's the lock
and then there's

1675
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,450
this schematic above it.

1676
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:02,320
So we have three
possible entries.

1677
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,784
This is x_i or not x_j or x_k.

1678
01:15:06,784 --> 01:15:08,200
And we're going
to use this gadget

1679
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,376
to say, well if you come
down the true path from here,

1680
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:13,250
you're going to have to
push this block down,

1681
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,850
which prevents you from using
the other half of the gadget.

1682
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,922
So either you move Y
or you move X.

1683
01:15:18,922 --> 01:15:21,130
From then on, you can only
do west to south traversal

1684
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,740
or only north to east traversal.

1685
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,376
So it blocks the other path.

1686
01:15:25,376 --> 01:15:26,750
So this is--
because I don't want

1687
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,990
to come down here,
unlock the lock,

1688
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,740
and then go back on
a different path.

1689
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,280
Because that's not something
that's necessarily true.

1690
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,700
So as you come
down one of these,

1691
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,250
you force these gadgets to
be in a particular state that

1692
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:41,120
will only let you come back
the way you came-- go back

1693
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,000
the way you came.

1694
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,310
And then you can unlock
the lock and then

1695
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,900
this just connects back.

1696
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,400
OK?

1697
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,360
Then later, when we're
checking the clauses--

1698
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,860
when we come through
all the clauses

1699
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,443
to make sure that
they're true-- we're

1700
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:53,303
going to route those
from a to b, to a to b,

1701
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:54,635
to a to b for all the locks.

1702
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:56,260
And if they're all
unlocked, then we'll

1703
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,200
be able to traverse
them, and otherwise, not.

1704
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,560
That's the idea.

1705
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,600
OK.

1706
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,320
Then we have the
issue of a crossover,

1707
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,460
if we want to go into 2D.

1708
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:11,990
So we have-- here's a basic
crossover in the Push-1 model,

1709
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,520
or PushPush-1.

1710
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,900
If we're going to go from north
to south, then we will go-- OK.

1711
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,060
We can push this down.

1712
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,570
But we won't be able
to go to the east then.

1713
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,320
OK?

1714
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,820
And we're not able
to go to the west

1715
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,240
because if we push this
block, it gets stuck.

1716
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,950
So we can go north to
south, that's fine.

1717
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:32,420
And we can also go west to
east, by symmetry, essentially.

1718
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,500
But you can't go from west
to north or west to south,

1719
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,250
or any of the
other combinations.

1720
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,290
This works as long as
you do one or the other.

1721
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,990

1722
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:45,240
Once you do west to east, you
can't even do north to south.

1723
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,830
So that's why we call
it an XOR crossover.

1724
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,330
It's not what we want.

1725
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:52,470
But if we combine
things in this way,

1726
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:55,680
we get a uni-directional
crossover.

1727
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,540
This is one where-- I better
check my notes-- you can

1728
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:03,210
do with one of three things.

1729
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:07,120
You can do north to
south, if you want.

1730
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,850
And then you can
do west to east.

1731
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,967
So you could just
do west to east.

1732
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:15,050
Or you could do north to
south, then west to east.

1733
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:16,549
Or you could just
do north to south.

1734
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,290
Those are all possible here.

1735
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,500
So when we do north to south,
we prevent this particular thing

1736
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,690
from being traversed.

1737
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:26,510
But we unlock this gate, which
later, when we go west to east,

1738
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,300
will allow us to do it.

1739
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:35,740
So we go here and then these
are called no-reverse gadgets.

1740
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,220
So once you push
this block back,

1741
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,880
you can never go-- this
gadget becomes untraversible.

1742
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,397
So you come here, you push
this, push that, push that,

1743
01:17:45,397 --> 01:17:47,230
and now you can never
use this gadget again.

1744
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,260
So it's like a single-use thing.

1745
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,410
So you can come here.

1746
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:51,920
If you tried to
do that, you would

1747
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,089
get stuck because
this is a lock and it

1748
01:17:54,089 --> 01:17:55,130
hasn't been unlocked yet.

1749
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:58,180
So instead you've got to go over
here, go through this thing,

1750
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:01,110
permanently destroy it, and
then unlock this gadget,

1751
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,130
and then you exit.

1752
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,090
So that was north
to south traversal.

1753
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,690
We unlocked this gate and
we unlocked this gate.

1754
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,110
So if you're coming
west to east,

1755
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,140
it could be this has
been done or not.

1756
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,610
So going west to east, maybe
you haven't visited this gadget.

1757
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,140
Then you can just
go through here,

1758
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,730
block off a later north to
south traversal, that's OK.

1759
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,880
Then come over here and leave.

1760
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,020
And if you try to go
here, nothing happens.

1761
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,740
OK?

1762
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,840
Or it could be this has already
been done-- north to south--

1763
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,630
and then when you're
coming from the west,

1764
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:34,080
this has been unlocked, and
so you can open this gate

1765
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,240
and come through here.

1766
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,160
This has already been used,
so you can't go that way.

1767
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,660
So instead you use this one.

1768
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,230
This has already been unlocked,
so you can get through.

1769
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,387
And then you get out.

1770
01:18:46,387 --> 01:18:47,970
So with just a little
bit of checking,

1771
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,910
those are the only
things you can do.

1772
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,130
So when we have this
diagram -- I think

1773
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,090
I have one here --
variables and clauses,

1774
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:56,256
and you connect all the
variables to all the clauses

1775
01:18:56,256 --> 01:18:58,750
they're involved in-- this
is a slide from lecture one,

1776
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,190
but it's the same outline.

1777
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,590
You know the order in which
these crossings happen.

1778
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,300
Because you know I'm going to
visit variable i before I visit

1779
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,270
variable j greater than i.

1780
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:15,150
So I know how to order--
and each of these paths

1781
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,560
is really two paths,
one and then the other.

1782
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,260
And so I know whether
I'm going to do north

1783
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,620
to south before west to east.

1784
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:26,280
If not, I'd transpose the
gadget and exchange north-south

1785
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,660
with west-east.

1786
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,660
And then I don't need
that they're both visited.

1787
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:31,120
I don't know which ones
are going to be visited,

1788
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,530
but I could do one or the other.

1789
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,821
Or if I do both, I know one
will come before the other.

1790
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:37,460
So that kind of crossover
gadget is enough

1791
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:41,830
for Push-1 and PushPush-1.

1792
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:45,000
And it's exactly mimicking
what we did with Super Mario

1793
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,080
Brothers, we just had a
different variable choice

1794
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,090
and a different clause and a
different crossover gadget.

1795
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,350
But other than that, it
was exactly the same.

1796
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,860
The gadgets were different,
but the proof structure

1797
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,910
was the same.

1798
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,040
And that's our beginning
of 3SAT reductions.

1799
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,210
We will do many more next class.
