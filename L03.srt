00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,860
PROFESSOR: All right,
welcome back to 6.890.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,020
Today we continue our theme
of reductions-- NP-hardness

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,920
reductions from 3-partition.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,714
Yesterday we saw a couple of
different reductions from 3-

5
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,380
partition and then a
bunch of reductions

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,000
from those problems,
various puzzles.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
The last one we covered was
packing squares into a square.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,110
This is just a reminder
visually of what it looks like.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,220
But we're going to just
take this result as given.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,560
And our first
NP-hardness reduction

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,900
will be from packing
squares into a square.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,410
And then we will see
a bunch of-- possibly

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,730
as many as eight-- reductions
from 3-partition.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,720
So without further
ado, let's get started.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,200
The first problem we're
going to talk about

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,180
is edge-unfolding polyhedra.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,780
This is a geometric
folding problem.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,500
So if you're interested in
more, you can take 6.849.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
But here's a simple-- if you've
ever made a cube out of paper,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,370
probably you cut
out a cross shape

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,130
and then folded
it into the cube.

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,940
But if you want to know
what shape should I cut out

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,610
to make a cube, then
you want to know

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,700
where should I cut, which
edges of the cube should I cut?

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,080
They're drawn in red here.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,920
So that, when I unfold it,
I get one connected piece

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,100
without overlap.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,540
So for surfaces that are
topologically a sphere,

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,820
you want to cut along a
spanning tree of the edges.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,630
And for a cube, that
will always work.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,070
But for some polyhedra like
these two, when you unfold,

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,240
you get overlap.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,950
And in fact, no
matter which spanning

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,950
tree of the edges you take for
either of these two polyhedra,

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,240
you're guaranteed to fail.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,780
You cannot make these out of
one piece of paper by folding

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,930
and get an exact cover.

38
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,810
So that's bad news.

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,893
And these are old results.

40
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,280
These are back in 1998.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,620
But it remained an
open problem, how many

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,070
other examples are there?

43
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,100
If I give you a polyhedron, I
want to know is there an edge

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,650
unfolding?

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,820
We only cut along the edges.

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,640
What's the complexity of that?

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,640
And the answer is, it's
NP-complete, strongly

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,560
NP-complete, slightly stronger.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,710
This is not, obviously,
a number problem.

50
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,767
But in geometry,
you have this issue

51
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,600
of what are the coordinates
of the vertices.

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,630
So the coordinates could
be exponentially large

53
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,670
or they could just be
polynomially large.

54
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,120
Here they only be polynomially
large, so strongly NP-complete.

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
This is a complicated
proof so I'm just

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,212
going to sketch the
idea of how it works.

57
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,670
At the beginning,
like most proofs,

58
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,670
there's some kind of like
overall infrastructure

59
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,590
the holds all the
pieces together.

60
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,670
This is one part of that.

61
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,220
Well, this is the
main infrastructure

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,900
in this reduction.

63
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,810
There's some stuff
around the side.

64
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,320
This is mainly to make the
surface topologically a sphere.

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,260
The focus is on a
square face here

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,160
that has a little slit in it.

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,620
And there's a tower coming out.

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,080
It's drawn edge-on here.

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,610
This is the part we
actually care about.

70
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,090
I think, actually, it
will be redrawn here.

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,080
So we'll really just
be thinking about this.

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,050
And then, there's some
stuff that wraps around

73
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,450
it makes it a sphere
without changing unfoldings

74
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,880
So don't worry too
much about that.

75
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,020
Mainly we have this
giant-- think of it

76
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,500
as an obstacle
because we are not

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
allowed to overlap when
we unfold this thing.

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,669
So this shape can't
be cut up because it

79
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,967
has no edges except for here.

80
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,300
So this part can move around it.

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,170
It turns out that it
can just stay in there

82
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,270
but it might move up.

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,670
So we'll make a little
bit of space here.

84
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,730
There's this hole of this face.

85
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,830
Then there is this tower
that is sticking out

86
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,315
into the third dimension and
we need to somehow unfold

87
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,140
that thing and fit it in here.

88
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,630
Doesn't look possible
because this is not

89
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,360
quite drawn to scale.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,480
This is going to be super long.

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,465
So a lot of the stuff here
is just going to be stuffed

92
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:52,090
up the chimney, so to speak,
but also on the surface

93
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,750
there is more stuff going on.

94
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,300
So let's zoom into this thing.

95
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,700
If we unfold that
tower into a plus sign.

96
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,940
Most of it is lots
of tiny stuff called

97
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,150
atoms, which we will get to.

98
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,170
And then, the interesting
part from a 3-partition

99
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,050
standpoint-- or sorry, from
a square packing standpoint--

100
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,740
is there are some square faces.

101
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,180
And because we're edge
cutting our surface

102
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,960
those squares will
remain squares.

103
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,260
There's no edges on them.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,980
So those guys somehow have to
move around when you unfold.

105
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,660
And it's not drawn this
way, but the squares

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,810
are large enough that they
can't fit up the chimney.

107
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,750
OK, this chimney's actually
pretty narrow, constant width,

108
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,320
and those guys are
all really big.

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,190
So this other stuff can
move up the chimney,

110
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,420
but the squares will have
to stay in this square.

111
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,794
And that's how
we're going to get

112
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:45,480
packing squares into squares.

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,240
OK?

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,190
Now, the challenge is, what
we want to be able to do

115
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,900
is move the squares
around freely.

116
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,410
But in reality, we need to
make a connected 2D shape.

117
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,710
So somehow, we need to
connect together these squares

118
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,940
by some stuff-- that's
the mystery atoms--

119
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,070
so that, basically,
for any square packing,

120
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,430
we can arrange to
have those faces

121
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,267
in that rough arrangement.

122
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,850
And then the other stuff somehow
connects everything together.

123
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,130
And whatever doesn't fit in
here goes up the chimney.

124
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,800
So that's the plan.

125
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,840
If we zoom in--
all right, so this

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,030
is sort of the
diagram of that plan.

127
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,280
Imagine you have some
placement of the squares.

128
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,950
And we're going to try to
connect all the pieces together

129
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,390
maybe to some common root
in the lower left corner.

130
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,830
First we're just going to
draw some L's conceptually

131
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,520
to connect them all to here.

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,650
Those cross, which
is not allowed.

133
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,070
But then we're going to
reroute the L's to go around

134
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,320
the-- so, to get up
to this box, we're

135
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,360
going to go around all
the other boxes below it.

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,020
And in this way, we get a
non-crossing arrangement.

137
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,370
If we zoom in even closer,
these, I've drawn as lines,

138
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,290
but really they're
little strips of paper.

139
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,810
And they may do weird things
like zigzag back and forth.

140
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,750
How that happens
we'll see in a moment.

141
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,440
But this is to
convince you that,

142
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,880
at least if we
could place squares

143
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,660
and they're not like
right touching each other.

144
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,710
So we're going to shrink
each square a tiny bit,

145
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,168
which I won't get
into the details.

146
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:17,350
But if they're integer
square, let's say,

147
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,340
then we'll shrink them, maybe,
by minus 1 over n or something

148
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,230
polynomially small.

149
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,530
And then, that gives
us a little bit of room

150
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,260
to route all of these paths
if make them like 1 over n

151
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,670
squared or 1 over n
cubed in thickness.

152
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,760
Still polynomial, so
still strongly NP-hard.

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,460
So if we have a
square packing, we

154
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,000
can connect them
all up in this way

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,890
if we have these
magical atoms that

156
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,740
can do whatever we want freely.

157
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,730
And that's the-- so, in a little
more detail, in this picture,

158
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,020
we imagine the atoms as somehow
being connected together

159
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,620
in a chain, potentially.

160
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,540
And then when they unfold,
this is the fun part.

161
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,120
So we maybe-- for
connectivity purposes,

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,030
maybe first we want to visit
B_1, then we want to visit B_2,

163
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,540
and so on.

164
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,420
And that corresponds
to some traversal

165
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,650
on the surface of this
plus sign or the tower

166
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,330
that's sticking out.

167
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,310
And then, in 2D
when we unfold it,

168
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,334
we have a different thing
in mind of whether we

169
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:24,500
want it to go left or right.

170
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,830
So there's moving left or right
intrinsically on the surface.

171
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,740
And then there's moving left
and right in the unfolding.

172
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,260
So two separate things.

173
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,420
And conveniently,
this one structure

174
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,970
is one of these boxes-- this
is what we call the atom- can

175
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,220
do all of those things.

176
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,190
Certainly not obvious
from the picture,

177
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,750
it's just a little bumpy square.

178
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,680
But you just trial the cases,
these are three of the cases.

179
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,940
Not obvious, but there
turn out to be 10

180
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,740
after you remove
reflections and rotations.

181
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,520
There's a few things going on,
but the main thing going on

182
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:05,260
is whether you're going left or
right in the-- let me get this

183
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,842
straight-- whether you're going
left or right intrinsically

184
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:10,050
on the surface and whether
you're going left or right

185
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,300
or straight in the unfolding.

186
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,920
So here you can see you're
turning left in the unfolding,

187
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,710
you're going straight
in the unfolding,

188
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,610
and you're turning
left in the unfolding.

189
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,580
So the second coordinate
is L, S, and L.

190
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,610
What's less obvious
is if you fold this up

191
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,500
and you get the atom
structure, but the thing

192
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,790
that you attach to here
is on the folded structure

193
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,340
either to the left or to
the left or to the right.

194
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,280
So you just check
all these things.

195
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,880
And then, this is like
a universal glue that

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,900
can connect together the
squares however you want,

197
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,730
both on the surface where they
have to be connected originally

198
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,640
and in the unfolding
where you want

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,700
to match some square packing.

200
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,740
So we'll have a little bit of
hand waving there, lots of hand

201
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,270
waving, but in the end, you
get NP-strong, NP-completeness

202
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,940
of edge-unfolding polyhedra.

203
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,690
Any questions?

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,510
All right, perfectly
clear, then?

205
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,630
Let's move to another puzzle.

206
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,860
This is called the snake cube
puzzle or the cubra puzzle.

207
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,340
Here is one instantiation of it.

208
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,937
So we have-- it's
a chain of blocks--

209
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,520
I'm going to try to
unfold it in a way

210
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,769
that I can put it back
together, because it's actually

211
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,040
quite tricky to solve.

212
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,456
It's a chain of
blocks and there's

213
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:35,360
an elastic through the centers,
going through the center

214
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,020
of the faces.

215
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,460
And so, the result is you can't
really pull the squares apart,

216
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,820
it's a pretty tights elastic.

217
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,664
But you can spin.

218
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,330
Because from the
elastics point-of-view,

219
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,180
these are all equally happy.

220
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,270
So you're basically told
that-- I could also spin here,

221
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,210
but it doesn't do anything if
I stop at a 90 degree angle.

222
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,090
So I'm forced to
be straight here.

223
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,552
And then I'm forced to
have a 90 degree turn.

224
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,760
And then I'm forced to go
straight and then have a 90

225
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,650
degree turn and then go straight
and then have a 90 degree turn.

226
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,680
Here I have a few 90
degree turns in a row.

227
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,345
And that's the
general structure.

228
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:08,800
And can I still solve it?

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,870
Maybe.

230
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,840
The goal is to get into a cube.

231
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,240
And there are a bunch of
different versions, plastic,

232
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
wood, whatever.

233
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,590
This one is not solved and
so I will not do so well,

234
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,740
but you get an idea
of what it looks

235
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,340
like in its sort of flat state.

236
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,730
I can make it into
a kind of staircase.

237
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,670
So in general, this puzzle
is specified by a sequence

238
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,620
of lengths of straits.

239
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,230
And then, in between
those lengths

240
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,760
are the 90 degree turns.

241
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,260
OK?

242
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,904
So that's the puzzle,
pretty simple specification.

243
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,570
And your goal is to
fold it into a cube.

244
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,778
You know how big the cube is.

245
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,920
You just take the
number of little cubes

246
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,250
and take the cube root.

247
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:55,140
So this puzzle maybe goes, is at
least 1990, but could be older.

248
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,780
We don't know exactly.

249
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,350
And this puzzle is
also NP-complete.

250
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,520
And this proof is
also complicated

251
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,980
so we won't see all the details.

252
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,940
But this one, we'll probably
see a little bit clearer.

253
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,330
This is a proof by, in
particular, the three of us

254
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,290
and Marty in the back,
so all four of us.

255
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,110
And let's see, so this
doesn't look like a cube.

256
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,350
So lets-- before we try to
solve the problem of folding

257
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,980
into a cube shape, let's suppose
I give you one of these chains

258
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,790
and I want to know, can
it fold into this shape?

259
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,340
Let's say this is the target.

260
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,840
So it's a big box down here.

261
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,100
I think we call it the hub.

262
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,630
And then there are these
spokes, or just big boxes,

263
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,420
long boxes, sticking
out of the hub.

264
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,570
There's a hold here.

265
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,190
They're connected to
the main structure.

266
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,750
And you want to fold that.

267
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,750
And let's see, so
the big idea-- we're

268
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,670
reducing from
3-partition here--

269
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,660
we're going to represent a
number, a_i, as a zigzag--

270
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,630
well, sorry, shouldn't
call it a zigzag--

271
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,390
but we have a really long
bar, then a length 1 bar.

272
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,700
And then a really long
bar and a length 1 bar.

273
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,640
I'm drawing sort of
the thinned version.

274
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,170
This is really a little cube.

275
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,300
This is a little cube.

276
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,020
These are lots of cubes,
huge number of cubes.

277
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,090
OK?

278
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,610
So that's really, really big.

279
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,320
So big that the only
place it could fit

280
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,520
is down one of these spokes.

281
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,160
So of course, the idea is
these represent our triples

282
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,470
whose sum is equal to t.

283
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,930
And so, we have to
take these things

284
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,510
and because these
are so short, you

285
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,460
can't like go out of one
hub and jump to the next one

286
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,170
because there's a gap
there that's bigger than 1.

287
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,440
So once you commit to having
one of these long bars

288
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,124
into one of these
pockets, then all of them

289
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:53,290
have to go into the pockets.

290
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,010
So this is, in general, a big
issue with 3-partition

291
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,080
proofs is you want to
represent the number a_i

292
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,150
in some way that's
not divisible.

293
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,705
If you could take
a_i and split it

294
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:08,080
into two parts, than the
packing problem becomes trivial.

295
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,610
You'd split everything
into units or something.

296
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,180
So we have to make sure
a_i remains a single chunk.

297
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,420
We are, of course, encoding
a_i in your unary here,

298
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,030
because we have one
long bar per each a_i.

299
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,450
But for 3-partition,
unary is OK.

300
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,020
There's some things going
on here a little bit weird.

301
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,970
So you see this thing is
occupying the full length.

302
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,420
And the length here is going
to be 8 times the target sum

303
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,190
instead of just the target sum.

304
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,830
And we're multiplying this by 8.

305
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,950
So those are equal, we're fine.

306
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,070
There's a reason for the
8 which we will get to.

307
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,870
OK, now, like the
previous proof,

308
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,800
the edge-unfolding polyhedra,
we have these great units.

309
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,890
And we just like them
to be free floating.

310
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,930
And if you generalize this
puzzle little bit and say,

311
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,250
well, actually, I don't
just have one chain.

312
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,510
I have two chains.

313
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,460
Or I have n chains.

314
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,640
And together, collectively, they
have to fold into this shape,

315
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,380
then we're done except that
you would remove the box,

316
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,639
the box over here.

317
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,180
Because then, these
guys just somehow

318
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,260
have to be assigned to these
little pockets and we're happy.

319
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,707
OK.

320
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,290
All of these numbers--
although again,

321
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,990
not drawn to scale--
all these numbers

322
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,620
are much smaller than huge.

323
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,650
So you can't like take
this guy and put it here,

324
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,150
even though in this
picture it looks

325
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,800
like you might be able to.

326
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,300
All right.

327
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,790
So the issue is, now we want
to connect this together

328
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,150
into one big chain.

329
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,290
We have these units.

330
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,170
For each i, we have
one of these units.

331
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,500
That's cool.

332
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,190
And we want to
attach them together

333
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,770
in a way that is
super flexible, just

334
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,217
like the atoms we had before.

335
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,800
Now we're going to
use something which

336
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,508
we called the zigzag,
that's why I didn't

337
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:50,680
want to call this a zigzag.

338
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,570
This is all unit segments.

339
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,070
So you have 90 degree turn, 90
degree turn, 90 degree turn,

340
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,740
90 degree turn.

341
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,170
No straits.

342
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,180
This turns out to be
universal in a strong sense.

343
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,960
It can fold into anything.

344
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,050
And so, we can use it to
connect these parts together.

345
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,349
So what we're going to
do is have the a_1 gadget.

346
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,390
Then we're going to have
a whole bunch of zigzags

347
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,474
so you can go wherever
you need to go.

348
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:15,890
And then we'll
have the a_2 gadget.

349
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,840
And then we'll have
the universal zigzag

350
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,860
gadget for a long length of it.

351
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,870
And then the a_3.

352
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,580
And then alternating
between zigzags and the a_i.

353
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,700
And at the end, we'll
have enough zigzag

354
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,050
that we can fill all this
sort of extra garbage space.

355
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,500
But we will use this garbage
space in order to route around.

356
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,340
So maybe a_1's going to go here.

357
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,720
And so we do this
thing, this, yeah,

358
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,400
looks like some kind of cooker.

359
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,340
We go back and forth like that.

360
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,070
Then we'll have the
zigzag and say, OK, I

361
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,300
want to go over here next.

362
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,360
And then we'll do a_2 there.

363
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,930
And then we'll route over here.

364
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,240
And because this is in 3D,
crossings are not an issue.

365
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,800
I can just got out into
the third dimension.

366
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,680
We don't need much of a
third dimension, 8 is enough.

367
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,340
You can just, enough
to go over each other.

368
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,840
OK.

369
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,650
And then at the end,
we're going to fill in all

370
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,690
this space with the zigzag.

371
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,090
So let's talk about the zigzag.

372
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,510
What we claim-- there's
a couple different senses

373
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,260
in which it's universal.

374
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,320
But the key idea are
these sets of gadgets.

375
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,860
So we're drawing
here a two by two

376
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:30,170
by two cube made up
of 8 little cubes.

377
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,460
And if you look at the--
what we've drawn here

378
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,020
is the elastic that goes through
the centers of the cubes.

379
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,400
And notice it turns 90
degrees at every voxel,

380
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,150
at every little cube.

381
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,189
So this is part of-- these
are zigzag constructions.

382
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:50,280
So what we want to
say is that, if you

383
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,130
sort of-- so one
sense of universality

384
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,350
is that the zigzag
structure can fold

385
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,050
into any polycube structure.

386
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,630
Polycube is the 3D
generalization of polyominoes

387
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,750
that we saw last time
from polyominoe packing.

388
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,080
That's not true.

389
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,810
But if you take any
polycube structure

390
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,780
and you just scale
it by a factor of 2--

391
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,620
so you replace
every cube with a 2

392
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,550
by 2 by 2 grid
like this picture--

393
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,760
then it's still not true.

394
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,870
But it's better.

395
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,250
So what's true at that point
is if you take any path of two

396
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,880
by two by two
cubes, this is what

397
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
we would call a
Hamiltonian shape,

398
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,450
because there's one path
that visits everything

399
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,500
with no collisions.

400
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,570
So it has to be a path that
does not hit itself in 3D.

401
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,200
Then you can follow
these gadgets

402
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,210
in order to make any
turns you need to do.

403
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,620
Or you can go straight,
everything is possible.

404
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,140
I will talk a little bit
more about that in a moment.

405
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,080
So 2 by 2 by 2 refinement,
meaning scaling everything

406
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,770
by a factor of 2,
allows the zigzag

407
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,880
to make any Hamiltonian
shape scaled by 2.

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,987
But that's Hamiltonian shapes.

409
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,570
Now conveniently,
there's this theorem

410
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,445
which is used a lot in
computational geometry

411
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,880
and we use it in
this harness proof,

412
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,690
that if you take any shape and
you refine it by two by two

413
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,290
by two, every scale
by a factor of 2, then

414
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,290
it becomes Hamiltonian
by a similar kind

415
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,270
of gadget construction.

416
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,782
Although it's easier-- if you
just want Hamiltonian paths,

417
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,490
you don't care about
where you're turning

418
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,250
and where you're not turning,
so that's a pretty easy proof

419
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,630
left as an exercise to
you and sort of an aside

420
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,710
from this issue.

421
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,610
So we take any shape we 2 by
2 by 2, refine it, we make it

422
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,500
Hamiltonian.

423
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,930
Then we two by two
refine it again.

424
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,030
In total 4 by 4 by 4 refinement.

425
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,230
And then, a zigzag path can
make that polycube shape.

426
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,060
And this is for any polycube.

427
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,800
So that's cool.

428
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,710
Now, I'll mention
here in this proof,

429
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,850
one of the issues which
we'll see a bunch of times,

430
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,170
I'm just going to
mention it here,

431
00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:01,800
is we have a parity issue
because the cubical grid is

432
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,450
two-colorable, right,
you can checkerboard

433
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,140
the 3D grid of squares.

434
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,880
And so, what that
means is every time

435
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,421
you go from one cube on the grid
to another cube on the grid,

436
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,440
you're switching parity.

437
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,239
If you checkerboard the
3D space black and white,

438
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,780
you're always going from white
to black, then black to white,

439
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,620
then black to white, sorry,
alternating black and white,

440
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,470
easier to do than to say.

441
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,510
And so, that's a constraint.

442
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:37,890
So for example, it is impossible
in a 2 by 2 by 2 thing,

443
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,700
to enter from this
cube, the front cube,

444
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,470
and exit from this one just
by a counting argument.

445
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,460
So you start, let's say
this is a black cube.

446
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,941
This one also a black cube.

447
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,440
And so, you start black and
then you alternate black, white,

448
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,905
black, white, and
there's 8 things to visit

449
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,890
and you want to end black,
that's not possible.

450
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,350
You have to end white.

451
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,190
So if you enter on a black cube,
you will leave on a white cube.

452
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,340
And if you enter
on a while cube,

453
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,650
you will leave on a black cube.

454
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,082
So that's a constraint.

455
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:06,540
Doesn't really get
in the way here,

456
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,870
but it's something you
have to keep track of.

457
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,362
And the theorem
wouldn't be-- what

458
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,570
you'd like to say is, well,
I can enter from any cube

459
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,870
and leave from any cube.

460
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,640
And you could actually
prove that by induction,

461
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,500
except the base
case would be wrong.

462
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,400
So this is something
to be careful about.

463
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,360
This is the base case.

464
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,680
This is 1 cube, can I
enter from anywhere?

465
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,879
One 2 by 2 by 2
super cube, can I

466
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,170
enter anywhere, leave anywhere?

467
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,220
The answer is no, but
I can enter and exit

468
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
anywhere that have
the right parity.

469
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,215
So if the entrance
cubes and the exit cubes

470
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:37,130
have opposite parity, then this
is actually all of the cases.

471
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,570
These four are where the
entrance and exit cube

472
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,860
are adjacent to each other.

473
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,550
And these two cases are
where they're opposite

474
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,870
from each other, not touching.

475
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,700
And that's all the cases
with all the rotations

476
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,670
and reflections.

477
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,230
So once you prove that, base
case is actually really easy

478
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,650
to do by induction, you
just are essentially

479
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,226
pasting all these things
together to make any path.

480
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,100
And then we could make
any Hamiltonian shape.

481
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,630
And then further refinement,
any shape becomes Hamiltonian.

482
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,930
So that's how we prove
zigzags are universal.

483
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,842
And this connects together
all of these gadgets.

484
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,550
There's really two
gadgets in this proof,

485
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,730
the a_i gadgets--
there's n by n copies

486
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,370
of that-- and the
zigzag gadget--

487
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,112
there's n copies
of that as well.

488
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,570
Now there are some
details to check

489
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,710
here, of course, that the
zigzag gadgets can actually

490
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,890
navigate around and not cross
each other with height, 8,

491
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,140
and that at the end, you can
fill all the blank space.

492
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,740
If you're just organized
about how you traverse each

493
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,270
of the a_i's and where
you put the blank space,

494
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,900
I think we just
leave some headroom.

495
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,120
So you can just go
up, walk over to where

496
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,700
all the blank space is, just
serve do a scan line traversal.

497
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,090
Wherever there's blank
space, you eat it up

498
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,840
with your zigzag at the end.

499
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,700
So what this does is it
lets the a_i's move around

500
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,330
completely freely.

501
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,730
There shouldn't be any
constraints on how the a_i's

502
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,027
are assigned to these pockets.

503
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,610
Because we want every solution
to the 3-partition instance

504
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,020
to work here.

505
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,740
And the zigzags let us do that
because they're so universal.

506
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,300
Cool?

507
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,470
So I think that's what I
wanted to say about this proof.

508
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,185
Double check my notes.

509
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:21,740
Ah, there was one
other thing which

510
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,374
I found a little funny
re-reading this paper is why 8?

511
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:30,440
Because we know everything has
to scale up by a factor of 4.

512
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,600
And that's all we're
doing in some sense.

513
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,130
But we do make these-- we scale
all the a_i's by a factor of 8.

514
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,860
Not a big deal, but
there's a reason for 8.

515
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:51,300
If we just did 4 and
say-- so we want to go,

516
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,460
so this thing gets mapped onto
here and we go out and back

517
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,200
and out and back.

518
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,420
If we just did it
four times, we would

519
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,320
be arriving at basically
the same position in the 4

520
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,650
by 4 by 4 block.

521
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,010
Or sorry, we would be
arriving at the same 4

522
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,990
by 4 by 4 block that
we started from.

523
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,680
And that's not good because we
can only visit a block once.

524
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,549
So this is sort of an interface
issue between the zigzag--

525
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:14,340
which is nice and
universal, you can always

526
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,220
paste two of these
chains together,

527
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,925
no problem-- with this thing,
which is not universal.

528
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,600
It folds into
basically this shape.

529
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,370
That's it.

530
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,980
So we need to make
sure that, I mean,

531
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,014
we can universally do
whatever we want in here.

532
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:30,430
But we need to
make sure that when

533
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,690
we connect between this
zigzag structure and then

534
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,280
we paste in one of these
and then we come back,

535
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,720
that we do that in a valid
way from the perspective

536
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,730
of this big trunk
So the factor of 8

537
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,410
makes sure that if we leave
from one 4 by 4 by 4 chunk,

538
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,880
we come back on a different one.

539
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,220
And then it's easy to paste
all the paths together.

540
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,570
So that is Ham paths.

541
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,444
Yeah?

542
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,180
AUDIENCE: So, I don't
quite see that this

543
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,052
proves that snake cube is NP.

544
00:23:58,052 --> 00:23:58,760
PROFESSOR: Right.

545
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,350
Ah, yeah there's one
more issue, which

546
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,260
is this was folding this shape.

547
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
But we want to fold a cube.

548
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,620
Yeah.

549
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,290
This is the kind of
annoying part of the proof.

550
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,450
It's very hard to draw.

551
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,480
This isn't my attempt
at drawing it.

552
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,330
And yeah, I will
sketch the idea.

553
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,630
I tell you, the first part is
conceptually easy, again, hard

554
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,260
to draw.

555
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,970
The issue is forcing this
chain of blocks to do anything.

556
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,640
And one key idea is
if you want to fold,

557
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,270
let's say, a k by
k by k box, if you

558
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,082
have a straight
path of length k,

559
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:39,040
there aren't very many
places you can put that.

560
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,440
I mean, I guess there are still
k or there's k squared of them.

561
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,850
But you have to start
and end at the beginning

562
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,770
and end of the
overall cube, if you

563
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,460
have a full length of straight.

564
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,430
So the first step we do
is take your-- sorry,

565
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,910
this is the first step.

566
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,830
It's upside down because we're
doing things in reverse order.

567
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,180
First thing we do is
we take a target cube

568
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,480
and we're basically going to
have a lot of really long guys

569
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,054
will force you to in a row.

570
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:09,720
And you see then these
kinds of puzzles.

571
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,190
You tend to have straits
of length 3 like this.

572
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,250
These are three 3's in a row.

573
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,840
And we're making a
3 by 3 by 3 cube.

574
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,990
So that sort of has to live in,
well, it can do weird things.

575
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,760
But it's relatively restricted.

576
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,470
Maybe you can do
something like this.

577
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,750
But then, these must be the
edges of the cube in that case.

578
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,250
So we have a bunch of
those and lots of care,

579
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,150
and we end up reducing
the cube to a box,

580
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,720
meaning we cover
all of the cube.

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,390
We're forced to cover
all of the cubic

582
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,760
and leave exactly a box behind.

583
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,490
Sort of like what we did when we
were doing squares into square.

584
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,080
We put a bunch of big boxes
that were relatively constrained

585
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,270
and it just left empty
space, which is a box.

586
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,920
Here it's actually
forced exactly.

587
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,480
Then, once we have a box, so
the box will be this wide.

588
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,340
And it will go over this way.

589
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,930
But it won't have this
sort of fine feature stuff.

590
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,960
This will just all be
filled in as a box.

591
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,580
Then this step that's drawn
is to carve out this hub

592
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,530
and spoke shape.

593
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,560
And that's based on a
structure like this.

594
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,660
We have a huge thing.

595
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,810
And then a relatively
short thing of length

596
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,302
about 8t, And then we go down.

597
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,510
And then immediately back up.

598
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,410
And then over and
down and up and so on.

599
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,736
And that roughly carves
out this structure.

600
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:37,110
Now, you have to be careful
that this is actually unique.

601
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,899
This is why we only want the
height of this box to be 8,

602
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,940
because then you can't go
out of plane very much.

603
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,780
And while this is short,
it's longer than 8

604
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,200
if t is bigger than 1.

605
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,490
So you can't have
this spoke go up.

606
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,360
So it does have to
live in a plane.

607
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,170
Sounds right.

608
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,640
And this is much
smaller than huge,

609
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,232
so you can't fold
it some other way.

610
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,440
So that's pretty much forced.

611
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,130
And then we have to get rid of
the other seven planes, which

612
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,472
we do with really long guys.

613
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:11,430
Unfortunately, we don't
have all of that drawn,

614
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,560
so it's especially hard to see.

615
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,550
But this is a rough idea
of how you start with a box

616
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,390
and you do these sort of
infrastructure gadgets

617
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,380
to just carve out
the shape you want.

618
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,250
And then you go into the
interesting part of the chain.

619
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,000
This is all at the
beginning of the chain.

620
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,990
And as you show, it's
forced to do all this.

621
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,940
And then we start say here
with some zigzag and then

622
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,626
an a_i gadget and so on.

623
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,480
Whew.

624
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,270
Easy, right?

625
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,670
So, you do see
here, I would say,

626
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,190
a very algorithmic approach.

627
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,610
I mean, this idea of showing
that zigzags are universal,

628
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,360
they can make any
shape, this is something

629
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,260
we do in computational
geometry all the time.

630
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,843
We prove that these
folding structures

631
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:55,350
fold into whatever we want.

632
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,610
So we're-- and we hadn't
prove this one before,

633
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,670
but we were armed with a lot of
algorithmic tools to do this.

634
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,500
And that let us
do this reduction.

635
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,470
So lower bounds in
our case is really

636
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,420
all about designing the
right algorithms to give you

637
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,760
powerful gadgets like this.

638
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,920
That's why this is the class
called algorithmic lower bound.

639
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,251
Other questions
about snake cubes?

640
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:18,750
Adam.

641
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,750
AUDIENCE: Why 8 instead of 6?

642
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,550
PROFESSOR: I think we want
it to be a multiple of 4

643
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,700
so that it's compatible
with the grid.

644
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,000
6, yeah, that seems cleaner.

645
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,900
That way we can predict
if we leave on this 4 by 4

646
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,941
by 4 thing, we know which
one we'll come back on.

647
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:39,290
Whereas, if it could be
in a half-grid position,

648
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,400
that would be messy.

649
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,135
Other questions?

650
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:44,760
You might be able to
make that to work,

651
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,470
but the advantage of hardness
proofs, because it's not

652
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,570
a real algorithm.

653
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,960
I mean, it's an algorithm
that you'd want to run.

654
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,800
The point is to show
this problem is hard.

655
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,536
You can be inefficient
in lots of places.

656
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:54,910
As long as it's
still polynomial,

657
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,480
it doesn't really matter.

658
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,390
Except for drawing
the pictures, that's

659
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,490
one place where it matters.

660
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,300
All right.

661
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,780
That's snake cubes.

662
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,550
I'm gonna go on to
another packing problem.

663
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,580
So we've seen rectangles into
squares, squares into squares,

664
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,220
how about circles into squares?

665
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,660
So this is a real
life puzzle where

666
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,330
you have these-- I think they're
water jet cut or laser cut--

667
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,710
metal disks.

668
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,260
And you have to fit
them into this box.

669
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,870
So these are real life puzzles.

670
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,147
That's one motivation.

671
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:32,480
There's a stronger motivation
for studying this problem,

672
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,050
because it's related to
computational origami.

673
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,942
There's this method called the
tree method of origami design.

674
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,400
If you're interested
in it, you can

675
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,910
take 6.849 or read Robert Lang's
book, Origami Design Secrets.

676
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,500
And basically, it lets
you fold things like this.

677
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,680
That's at a high level.

678
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,430
And a key component of it is
to pack disks into a square.

679
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,080
The square is your
piece of paper.

680
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,170
The disks correspond to sort
of the limbs of your creature.

681
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,749
And you can't use the
same piece of paper

682
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,290
to represent this
limb and this limb,

683
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,200
so the disks have
to be disjoint.

684
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,240
So it's all about packing
those disks into given square.

685
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,550
And yeah, so that's
at a high level

686
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,810
why we care about disk packing.

687
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,814
And people have thought
about disk packing a lot.

688
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,480
But surprisingly, it
hadn't been proofed

689
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,990
hard until four years ago.

690
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,750
So this proof is
also complicated.

691
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,000
And it involves a lot of
geometry and trigonometry

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,350
and some calculus and fun stuff.

693
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,220
So I'm going to give
you a sketch of it.

694
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,200
You should be believable
that this works,

695
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,170
but the details,
again, are messy.

696
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,170
For starters, let's say
that we're packing disks

697
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,110
into an equilateral triangle.

698
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,490
This is much easier
to work with.

699
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,300
I'll go to a square in a second.

700
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,390
So if I have this
equilateral triangle, what

701
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,420
I'm going to do is,
first, I'm going

702
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,910
to give you a
bunch of disks that

703
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,790
are forced to pack in this nice,
triangular, grid arrangement,

704
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,044
leaving these dark holes.

705
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,585
And I'm going to
give you more disks,

706
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,780
and so the more disks have
to go into those holes.

707
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,850
And these are actually kissing
disks, they're touching.

708
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,210
So you can only put-- every
disk you put from now on

709
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,930
will be in one of these holes.

710
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,600
And I'm just going to do this
big enough so that I have

711
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,940
at least n over 3 holes.

712
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,380
Each hole is going
to represent a bin

713
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,830
that I'm trying to put a
triple of numbers into.

714
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,570
And then, here is the
construction for, I guess,

715
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,090
this would be a
3-partition gadget.

716
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,480
We want to get that-- oh, slight
typo there-- a_i plus a_j plus a_k

717
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,290
is less than or equal to t.

718
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,840
And so, these are
the three disks

719
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,610
representing a_i, a_j, and a_k.

720
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,070
And there's an extra
disk in the center.

721
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,890
And what's drawn here is
everything is maybe tight,

722
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,470
almost as touching.

723
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,890
But we're going to shrink
these disks a little bit--

724
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,340
or rather, I'm going
to shrink-- yeah,

725
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,630
I guess I'll shrink--
I'll get this right-- I'm

726
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,824
going to shrink this
disk a little bit.

727
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,740
And I'm going to make
these one's a little bit

728
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,380
bigger according
to the a_i values.

729
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,104
So this one will be
proportional to a_k larger

730
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,520
than the disk that
would perfectly

731
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,760
fit here if this one
was maximally-sized.

732
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,160
And so, that's going to
force this guy to move away.

733
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Well, he's a little
bit shrunk, so maybe he

734
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,560
doesn't have to move away.

735
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,390
But this center disk,
when it shrunk down,

736
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,380
it has a little
bit of flexibility.

737
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,800
It could move more this way.

738
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,133
And if this disk is smaller,
it will move more this way.

739
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,130
It could move more this
way, more this way.

740
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,855
And in general, you show
that-- so these guys

741
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:43,230
are sort of placing demands
by being a little bit bigger.

742
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,900
They need to push out.

743
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,370
And this one is a
little bit smaller.

744
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,660
And its size is just
a function of t.

745
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,730
And so, it's going
to move around.

746
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,800
And the claim is, it has a
valid position if and only

747
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,912
if a_i plus a_j plus a_k is
less than or equal to t.

748
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,235
I have written down a
little bit of the details.

749
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,280
So we're going to choose some
big number capital N, maybe

750
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,080
it's like n to the 100,
little n to the 100, something

751
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,860
like that.

752
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,070
And we'll shrink the
big disk by that amount.

753
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,085
I'm going to scale everything
so that t equals 1.

754
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,120
That will simplify
things a little bit.

755
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,010
So just shrink everything,
all the values, down,

756
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,340
divide everything
by t, a_i's in the t.

757
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:51,029
And then, I think we're going
to shrink the a_i disk by minus 1

758
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:57,210
over n squared plus a_i over n.

759
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,150
This is a funny
notion of shrink.

760
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,839
I'm going to first make it
smaller by 1 over n squared.

761
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,170
And then I'm going to
grow it by a_i over n.

762
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,069
This term, I believe,
is to get rid

763
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:11,390
of smaller things in
the Taylor expansion.

764
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,799
So disks are annoying
because they're circular.

765
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,920
Because they're
quadratic curves.

766
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,190
And so, you get-- you know, it's
an awkward shape to deal with.

767
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,310
And you're worried about
how I move this center

768
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,739
relative to how I
move the other centers

769
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,110
and whether they're
hitting each other.

770
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,380
And whether hitting each other
is a quadratic constraint.

771
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,796
You have to measure the distance
between these two points.

772
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:36,320
It should be greater than or
equal to the sum of the radii.

773
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,730
So that's tough to work with.

774
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,180
So to simplify things,
we take first derivatives

775
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,650
and say, well, to the first
order, what's happening

776
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,200
when I move these disks around?

777
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,280
And when you say
first derivatives,

778
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,340
you get an approximation
to the truth.

779
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,910
And the second derivative, it
tells you a little bit more

780
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,790
of the truth.

781
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,570
And if you've ever
done Taylor series,

782
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,467
you know you get
something like 1

783
00:34:57,467 --> 00:35:00,050
over n, something times 1 over
n plus something times 1 over n

784
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,980
squared and so on.

785
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,250
And so, if we just
subtract off this term,

786
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,110
make these disks a little bit
smaller than they need to be,

787
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,790
that lets you deal with all
those terms all at once.

788
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,340
So it lets us focus
on the lead term.

789
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,700
And to the first order, the
claim is, what happens is,

790
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,470
well, we made this
disk smaller by 1.

791
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,090
Remember 1 is t.

792
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,120
We made the other
guys larger by a_i.

793
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,890
So that's going to
work out exactly

794
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,730
when the sum of the three a_i's
is less than or equal to 1.

795
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,952
Then this will have room.

796
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,410
And that's true to
the first order.

797
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,000
And you have to do
this ugly business

798
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,260
to make it true exactly.

799
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,340
So I think, without going
into vector algebra,

800
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,660
this is the intuition
of what's going on.

801
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,910
And that's that proof.

802
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,415
Any questions?

803
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,790
The point here is to expose
you to lots of different ways

804
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,700
to represent numbers
and 3-partition.

805
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,650
And a lot of times it comes
up in geometric settings.

806
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,300
But so far, we've seen rather
different ways to represent it.

807
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,020
We'll see graph
theory in a moment.

808
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,930
Probably, next up is
games and puzzles.

809
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,430
So let's play some games.

810
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,229
Right, there was one more
part of this proof I forgot.

811
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:15,770
What if you're
packing into a square?

812
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,790
This is particularly
important for origami.

813
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,740
This paper appeared in
an origami conference,

814
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,460
so we needed to solve the
case of square packing.

815
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,860
This is more awkward.

816
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,960
The idea, because you can't make
a nice, regular grid on a-- you

817
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,390
know, square grid packing is
not very efficient for disks.

818
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,752
But if you have these
four really big disks,

819
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,710
I should mention here
the goal is for the disks

820
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,352
to fit-- the centers of the
disks to fit inside the square.

821
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:42,060
That turns out to be
the right constraint

822
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,250
from an origami perspective.

823
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,890
So, we would make
these four big disks,

824
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,450
they have to be at the corners.

825
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,800
Then we make this big disk,
it has to be in the center.

826
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,670
These are all
perfectly touching.

827
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,309
Then we add these
four disks and it

828
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:55,850
forces a particular
arrangement here,

829
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,080
which is a little awkward
to compute but you can.

830
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,757
And yes, we do that four times.

831
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,340
Then, for each of
these constructions,

832
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,910
this is the shape that we want.

833
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:10,405
We want these kind of
equilateral triangle-ish gaps.

834
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,280
I say ish because they're
not straight sides,

835
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,720
they're arc sides.

836
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,310
But it is-- the centers form an
equilateral triangle perfectly.

837
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,850
Then we recurse.

838
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,870
So wherever we have a gap like
that, which is this thing,

839
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,420
then we add the center guy.

840
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
And then we add these
four disks again,

841
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,385
just like over here,
three times now.

842
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:34,760
Now, of course, we can't
force the disks to go here.

843
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,690
But they will.

844
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,530
This is a very
symmetric construction.

845
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,446
So we're going to do
this symmetrically in all

846
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:43,690
the things.

847
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,360
The other challenge is we left
these rather large gaps here.

848
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,990
I mean, relative to
these tiny disks,

849
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,290
which are all fit inside that
gap, this is pretty big gap.

850
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,950
So we also have
to make these gaps

851
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,102
unusable by adding
a maximal disk

852
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:58,310
and then adding maximal disk.

853
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,800
And just recursively
adding maximal disks

854
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,970
until the gaps that are left
are tinier than all the ones

855
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,060
that we're going to
produce in this recursion.

856
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,640
This recursion has depth
like log n, so in the end,

857
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,260
we get roughly n of
these things or n over 3.

858
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,800
If we have extras, we'll
just throw in maximum disks

859
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,790
and make them unusable.

860
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,112
So that's it.

861
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,570
So this is a lot
harder because you

862
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,044
have to fill in
all of these gaps

863
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,960
and make sure everything
is going to be happy.

864
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
And no disk can go
in the wrong place.

865
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
But if you sort of do
it in the right order,

866
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
you can be convinced
at every stage

867
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,984
you're disk has to go
where you're putting it.

868
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:36,900
Except at the very end
where you have freedom.

869
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,520
The freedom you have is where
the a_i's go, which pocket they

870
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,760
belong to.

871
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,360
That's the only
freedom you have.

872
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,000
It's the only freedom
we want you to have.

873
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,710
OK.

874
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,560
So that was disk packing.

875
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,650
Next is Clickomania .

876
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,530
How many people have
played Clickomania?

877
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,500
A few.

878
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,520
Good.

879
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,900
It's not completely obscure yet.

880
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,850
So here I have the
real thing, I think

881
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,292
this is called Clickomania,
Next Generation.

882
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,750
And I want to start
a new game so I

883
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,800
don't have a really bad score.

884
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,300
So the idea is
you're going to click

885
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,020
on a group, a connected
group, of one color.

886
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,250
That group is destroyed.

887
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,890
And then things fall vertically.

888
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,630
So column-by-column.

889
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,120
Rules clear?

890
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:28,660
Your goal is to remove all of
the blocks, which I probably

891
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,210
won't succeed in doing.

892
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,940
I haven't played in a long time.

893
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,080
But let's-- I would like
to show you one other rule,

894
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,530
but I may fail to do so.

895
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,350
This kind of
checkerboarding, not so good.

896
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,580
Don't do that when you play.

897
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,080
Also very bad.

898
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,060
OK.

899
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,820
The one rule, which I
won't demonstrate here,

900
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,110
is if you clear a
column, then these guys

901
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,490
just sort of eat the column.

902
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,240
They just move
closer to each other.

903
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,750
I think usually the right
moves to the left one step.

904
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,670
OK, so that's-- here's a
successful execution from

905
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,330
the Clickomania website.

906
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,340
But I have done it a few times.

907
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,590
I just haven't in a long time.

908
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,410
The only rule is, the
group that you click on,

909
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,870
the connected color chunk has
to be of size greater than 1.

910
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,970
Otherwise you could just
keep clicking on everything.

911
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,690
So that's why the
checkerboarding is bad,

912
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,120
because there you
have singleton guys.

913
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,620
So you may have
some singleton guys.

914
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,130
But if you're careful, you
sometimes can get rid of them.

915
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,260
The question is, when can you?

916
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,610
And the answer is,
it's NP-complete.

917
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:44,160
So this is actually my
first NP-hardness proof,

918
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,940
I think ever.

919
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,140
Definitely of a game.

920
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,300
I think ever.

921
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,760
So there's a few results here.

922
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,130
One is that, if you have
a single column, that case

923
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,750
we can solve.

924
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,940
A single row actually behaves
the same as a single column,

925
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,580
because even though they're
asymmetric in general, for when

926
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,300
it's 1, they're the same.

927
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,770
And if you happen to know
context-free grammars,

928
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,900
then here's the answer.

929
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,660
It's not obvious that
this is the answer.

930
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,789
But this is saying something
like, well, it could

931
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,080
be you already solved the game.

932
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,370
That's the empty string.

933
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,399
Or it could be you have
a solvable game followed

934
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,190
by a solvable game.

935
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,030
You could just sort
of do them separately.

936
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,470
And if you're careful, they
won't mess each other up.

937
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,350
And then you solve
the overall game.

938
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,400
Or it could be you
have a solvable game

939
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,240
and you have the same color,
one block of the same color,

940
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,177
on either side.

941
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:33,260
That would also be solvable
because you could just

942
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,420
solve the center thing.

943
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,990
Then these two
guys come together.

944
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,400
And then you click
that group of size 2.

945
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,830
Or this could also happen
where you solve two things

946
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,476
and then three
blocks come together.

947
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:44,100
And you could also
imagine other rules.

948
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,725
But it turns out
these are enough rules

949
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:48,880
to capture all solvable
puzzles for one row or column.

950
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,210
But that's not a hardness proof
so we won't talk about it.

951
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,610
We have two NP hardness results.

952
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,740
One is for two columns
and five colors.

953
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,560
And the other one
is a hardness proof

954
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,410
for five columns
and three colors.

955
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,980
And these are the proofs.

956
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,830
This one is 3-partition.

957
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,147
This one is 3SAT.

958
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:12,980
So we might talk about
that in the 3SAT

959
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,800
section of the class.

960
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,260
But I'm going to focus here
on the 3-partition--

961
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,350
two columns, five colors.

962
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,240
Open problem is
whether two colors,

963
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,670
you can get any hardness.

964
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,403
Question?

965
00:42:25,403 --> 00:42:27,987
AUDIENCE: Is it obvious
that S to SS is--

966
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:28,570
PROFESSOR: No.

967
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,710
It's not obvious that
S to SS is valid.

968
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,980
Because you worry that
when you solve one of them,

969
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,086
you might eat a group
from the right-hand side.

970
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,710
But you can prove
it's always possible.

971
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,293
I don't remember how
that proof works,

972
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:42,310
but you can check the paper.

973
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah.

974
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,260
If you look at the-- if you
ever go to the course website

975
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,230
and watch this lecture
or click around

976
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,680
the slides of this lecture,
it has links to all the papers

977
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
that I'm talking about.

978
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,640
So if you ever want to know
more details, just go there.

979
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Link is right there.

980
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,260
You don't have to type in all
these names and Google for it.

981
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,760
Cool.

982
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,240
So this is my attempt at
drawing the hardness proof.

983
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,930
This was challenging.

984
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:12,090
And I should say, it's
not drawn to scale.

985
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,610
So it's not exactly right.

986
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,940
But it gives you a
flavor of what happens.

987
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,000
And I believe all the
braces are correct.

988
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,990
But it just wouldn't
fit on the screen

989
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,180
if we drew everything
properly to scale.

990
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,510
So reduction from
3-partition.

991
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,860
We have n numbers, a_i
through an integers.

992
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,350
We're going to
scale everything up.

993
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:37,000
We're going to scale the
a_i's and t by a factor of b.

994
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,880
b is 4/3n.

995
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,780
I don't totally know
why, but you know.

996
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,925
It's n plus the
number of groups.

997
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:47,800
I'm guessing a larger
number would also work,

998
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,880
but that's definitely enough.

999
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,390
OK.

1000
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,732
So basically, there's
two columns, remember.

1001
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,440
It's always going to
stay in two columns.

1002
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,580
It never increases.

1003
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,560
There are some clickable
blocks, clickable groups,

1004
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,980
which correspond to the a_i's.

1005
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,540
So for every day a_i, we're
going to have exactly one block,

1006
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,806
which is b times a_i by 1.

1007
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:11,180
Don't draw the
lines when they're

1008
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,180
in the same connected component.

1009
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,920
But technically, these
are separate squares.

1010
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,120
There's also some
clickable things up here.

1011
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,600
Those are not too essential.

1012
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,550
They're basically to spread
out these red blocks.

1013
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,380
There are n over
three red blocks here.

1014
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,220
And there are n over
3 red blocks here.

1015
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,930
You will never win
the game unless you

1016
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,460
destroy these red blocks.

1017
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,721
So for example, you could
click all these blue things,

1018
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:40,720
make the red together,
and then destroy the red.

1019
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,370
But that's not a good idea.

1020
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:47,080
Because these are only,
this is a very small space.

1021
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,780
This is a relatively large gap.

1022
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,480
I know it doesn't
look like it, but this

1023
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,440
is only n over 3 total.

1024
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,280
The gap between
these two things is

1025
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,210
b times t, which is way
bigger than n over 3.

1026
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,870
OK, so there's big gaps
between these red guys.

1027
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,970
So what you're
basically going to do

1028
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:08,890
is make this column fall down
until the first red guy aligns

1029
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:09,680
with this one.

1030
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,255
Then you delete those two.

1031
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,630
Then you're going
to make it fall

1032
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,894
down farther until this
red guy hits this one.

1033
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:17,310
And then you can
delete those two.

1034
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,946
Just two at a time.

1035
00:45:18,946 --> 00:45:21,320
And we're going to bring it
down until the third guy hits

1036
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,600
third guy, and then the fourth
guy hits the fourth guy.

1037
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,056
Then the reds are gone.

1038
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,430
Before I get to
how that happens,

1039
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,950
let me tell you what happens
when the reds are gone.

1040
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,850
When the reds are gone, I mean,
if there are any purples left--

1041
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,860
turns out there won't be--
but you could click them all.

1042
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,276
Then you could
click all the blue.

1043
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,210
Then you're done on
the right column.

1044
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,580
So right column was
finishable, no problem,

1045
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,260
once you've gotten
rid of the red.

1046
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,715
Now the left column is
mostly checkerboard.

1047
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,420
And if you remove
the red pixels,

1048
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,520
you're left with exactly a
checkerboard except here,

1049
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,030
the topmost red guy.

1050
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,490
It's white on either side.

1051
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,920
And in general, everything
below this point

1052
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,701
is the same as everything
above this point upside down.

1053
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:09,200
And so then you can always just
click on the center, center,

1054
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,830
center, center.

1055
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,205
I guess you have to move your
mouse down as that happens,

1056
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:16,500
but you will then destroy
the black and white part.

1057
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,770
Total is five colors.

1058
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:21,540
We've got red, purple,
blue, black and white.

1059
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,360
OK, now this is my
attempt at showing you

1060
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,190
how we get the red
things to align.

1061
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,780
But the idea is simple.

1062
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,301
The initial gap from
this guy to this guy.

1063
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:36,050
And then, the gap
henceforth from this one

1064
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,545
to this one to
this one is always

1065
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,320
b times t plus some constant.

1066
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,070
The constants are just annoying.

1067
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,450
So they're not essential.

1068
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,255
The idea is, well, I've got
to bring this down b times t.

1069
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:48,630
So in order to do
that, I'm going

1070
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,640
to click on some purple things
whose total size is b times t.

1071
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,400
In other words, the sum of
the a_i's that I'm clicking on

1072
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,840
should be equal to t.

1073
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
And we happen to know
that will be three things,

1074
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,724
but that's not essential here.

1075
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:03,140
We can just use
the simple version

1076
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,370
of 3-partition, where
you're asking for sets

1077
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:08,010
that happened to sum to t.

1078
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,105
Because everything is scaled up
so big by these factors of b,

1079
00:47:11,105 --> 00:47:13,420
I mean, these
gaps-- you have to,

1080
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,760
even to get in the right
proximity, you have to choose

1081
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,620
a_i's that sum to exactly t.

1082
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,710
Yes.

1083
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,080
So the constants are annoying
because you want to make sure--

1084
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,380
so here's an example.

1085
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,580
Here are, in this
particular picture,

1086
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,770
the height of one of
these things is 6.

1087
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,740
And so, I click on one
purple thing of size 4

1088
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,112
and one purple thing of size 2.

1089
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:41,070
In reality, these numbers
would be much bigger,

1090
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,870
but for the picture, that works.

1091
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,620
Then things fall.

1092
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,690
And we get this picture.

1093
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,480
And these red things are almost
aligned, but they're off by 2,

1094
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,180
so I click on this
little 1 by 2 block.

1095
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,390
And then they're aligned.

1096
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,660
Then I can click
on the red thing.

1097
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,420
I also click on this blue
thing to sort of advance

1098
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,570
to the next red thing.

1099
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,370
And then these guys fall
and I get this picture.

1100
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,560
I could click on the
white but it won't matter.

1101
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,660
That's just, I could do
that all at the end later.

1102
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,530
Now my goal is to get
this red thing to here.

1103
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,680
Again, the gap is exactly 5.

1104
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,500
So I click on, let's say, 6.

1105
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,880
Let's say I click on
2 things of size 3.

1106
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,580
And so then everything falls.

1107
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,580
And the reds align.

1108
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,590
Then I delete it.

1109
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,770
I also delete the
blue thing to advance.

1110
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,910
And I think that works.

1111
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,856
Yeah, question.

1112
00:48:31,856 --> 00:48:32,740
AUDIENCE: How do you
ensure that it's always

1113
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,544
the leading red
block that has to go

1114
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,312
with the trailing red
block on the left?

1115
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:37,020
PROFESSOR: Right.

1116
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,340
So it could be you take some
other block, other red block,

1117
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,980
and align it with this one.

1118
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,880
That is mostly a worry from
a construction standpoint.

1119
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,480
If you did that,
you might get stuck.

1120
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,810
But I claim if I did that, it's
never a problem to do that.

1121
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:58,870
Because this length is, this
total extent of these red guys,

1122
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,620
is relatively small.

1123
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,390
The whole length here is n.

1124
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,430
Sorry, it's 3 times n over 3.

1125
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,170
Whole length is n
whereas all these a_i's

1126
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,040
are scaled by a factor
of much bigger than n.

1127
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,310
Well, not a huge amount
bigger, but bigger than n.

1128
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,110
So even to get them
vaguely to the right--

1129
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,950
this is what I was saying--
to get this red block or any

1130
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:20,130
of these red blocks
near this one,

1131
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,300
because these things
are scaled so huge,

1132
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,540
to get one close is the same
as getting all of them close.

1133
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,180
If you happen to succeed in a
way that gets the reds to align

1134
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,232
in an out of order, that would
still give a valid solution

1135
00:49:35,232 --> 00:49:36,190
to the 3-partition.

1136
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:36,880
That's the point.

1137
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,421
Because we scaled
everything so huge.

1138
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:44,740
To do the other direction, say,
if you have a solution of 3-

1139
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,520
partition, then there's a
solution to this instance,

1140
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,150
there we do it in order so that
we're in control and make sure

1141
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,140
all the constants add up right.

1142
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,520
And that's sort of the
annoying part of this proof.

1143
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,480
But this is a
relatively easy proof,

1144
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,460
except for these little
additive constants

1145
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,010
to make sure
everything lines up.

1146
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,730
It would be great if I
could just put these reds

1147
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,580
on top of each other.

1148
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,050
But then they're one group and
you delete them all at once.

1149
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,950
So I have to put these
things in between.

1150
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,075
They have to be length 2
so that I can destroy them

1151
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,370
whenever I want to.

1152
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,950
And so, all these
additive constants

1153
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,908
kind of get in the way.

1154
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:18,280
But it's not too bad.

1155
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,700
Other questions
about this proof?

1156
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:23,090
That's Clickomania.

1157
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,160
Cool.

1158
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:38,380
Next is Tetris, as advertised
in the original, first lecture.

1159
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,580
So if you haven't
played Tetris, here

1160
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,620
is the-- I hope
you've played Tetris.

1161
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,690
I played a lot as a kid.

1162
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,210
You have these
tetragonal blocks.

1163
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,660
You can rotate them.

1164
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,140
And then you can force
drop them or you can slowly

1165
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,235
drop them and do weird
things like that,

1166
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:59,136
you know, sort of
last minute moves.

1167
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:01,360
Let's see.

1168
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,760
I don't think that's-- yeah,
the rotation centers are always

1169
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,360
a bit funny, so you
can do cool things.

1170
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,240
So let's have some fun.

1171
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,140
I'll just play Tetris for
the rest of the class.

1172
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,050
So important rule is
when you complete a line,

1173
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,410
then that line disappears.

1174
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,274
Although in the proof, we will
prevent that from happening,

1175
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:31,400
it is a rule of the game.

1176
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,140
That's annoying.

1177
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,850
Also annoying.

1178
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,560
OK, well, you get the idea.

1179
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,460
You're super impressed
by my Tetris skills.

1180
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,180
All right, so cool.

1181
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,990
I used to play it on
GameBoy and then NES.

1182
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,600
You can play it on
the green building.

1183
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,640
This happened in 2012
finally, after it

1184
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,460
was dreamed for many years.

1185
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,360
I am a Tetris master according
to the Harvard Tetris Society.

1186
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,560
This was a for proving.

1187
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,940
I didn't have to play a game
to win this as you can tell,

1188
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,490
for proving NP-completeness and
maximization of aligns Tetris's

1189
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,490
pieces played, or
minimization of square height,

1190
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,532
we masters of the
Harvard Tetris Society

1191
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,740
hereby confer the title of
Tetris Master upon Erik D.

1192
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,390
Demaine on the 16th day of
the 12 month in the year 17

1193
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:27,784
Anno Tetri, which is since
the invention of Tetris.

1194
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:30,080
OK.

1195
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,030
This is a proof done
early in my career

1196
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,790
at MIT with two MIT students,
David Liben-Nowell and Susan

1197
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,610
Hohenberger, now professors
at other schools.

1198
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,560
This was a first
attempt at a proof.

1199
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,380
We had many attempts at
a proof, all of which

1200
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,470
were wrong except the last one.

1201
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,330
Yeah, anyway, you
could try to see

1202
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,680
what's wrong with that proof.

1203
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,610
But here is a working proof.

1204
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,340
This is actually not the
first working proof we had.

1205
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,000
So there is me,
David, and Susan.

1206
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,990
And then we published a much
harder version of the proof,

1207
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,540
with like 500 cases, and then
these three guys read our paper

1208
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,810
and said, hey, I think we
can simplify it like this.

1209
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,640
And then we wrote a
joint, journal version.

1210
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,430
So reduction is from
3-partition, surprise.

1211
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,820
So I should say,
what does Tetris

1212
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,100
mean from a computational
complexity standpoint?

1213
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,000
There are multiple
interpretations.

1214
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,290
Our interpretation is, I
give you an initial board.

1215
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,040
If you've already been
playing for awhile,

1216
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,520
here's what you have.

1217
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,300
And then I give you
the entire sequence

1218
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,850
of pieces that's going to come.

1219
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,670
And I want to know,
can you survive

1220
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,864
maximized number of lines.

1221
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:36,530
This is not yet the
approximability part

1222
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,988
of the class, but we get some
really easy inapproximability

1223
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:40,350
results, so I will mention them.

1224
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,300
For now, it's just
can you survive.

1225
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,760
The ceiling is like
here, a couple rows

1226
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,000
above this initial picture.

1227
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,300
So you're almost dead.

1228
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,610
So it's like every
second counts.

1229
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,420
All right?

1230
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:58,490
Your goal is to fill up
these chambers, these bins,

1231
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,450
exactly, with no holes.

1232
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,550
So if you could
do it, at the end

1233
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,072
I'm going to give
you a T and then

1234
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:05,840
a whole bunch of straights.

1235
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,860
And then you can win the game.

1236
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,070
All right?

1237
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,550
So we have n over
3 of these buckets.

1238
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:19,300
Each one is roughly t tall.

1239
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,700
There's some additive constant
to deal with some stuff,

1240
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,860
but there's t notches.

1241
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,880
Each of these is
basically counting

1242
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,300
one unit of an integer.

1243
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,641
OK?

1244
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:32,140
Yeah.

1245
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,010
The point is, if you
don't open this thing,

1246
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,730
where are the i's going to go?

1247
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,700
And you will only be able to
open this thing if this is full

1248
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,010
and this is full and this
is full and this is full.

1249
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,450
So you've got to get these
perfect so that at the top,

1250
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,952
you can open this and
then clear everything.

1251
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:51,360
OK.

1252
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,250
So here are the gadgets
from the piece perspective.

1253
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,020
That was the initial
configuration.

1254
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,920
Of course, there
are no a_i's yet.

1255
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,190
So the piece sequence has
to encode the a_i's in unary.

1256
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,060
Because if there are
only a constant number

1257
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,700
of different tetromino pieces,
so you have to encode-- well,

1258
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,600
I guess you could try
to encode in binary.

1259
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,840
It's very hard to add when
you're working with tetrominoes

1260
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,520
unless you do it in unary.

1261
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,940
So here's the idea.

1262
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,660
We have an initial
set-up like this.

1263
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,960
It will always have this
little thing in the corner.

1264
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,350
And so to say, hey,
a new a_i is starting,

1265
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,630
we're going to
give you, you might

1266
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,730
call this a
right-ward pointing L.

1267
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,220
If you look from the
barrel of the gun,

1268
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,450
then it goes to the right.

1269
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,120
So that makes a
nice flat face here.

1270
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,160
Because the next piece that's
coming is a 2 by 2 square.

1271
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,410
So what you're going to do
is let it drop all the way.

1272
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,880
And then at the
very last second,

1273
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,400
you slide it to the right.

1274
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,794
OK?

1275
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:48,460
And in general, we're
going to represent

1276
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,850
a_i by this pattern--
square, left

1277
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,780
L, square, to the power a_i.

1278
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,790
Like we're going to
repeat that a_i times.

1279
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,960
So here I repeated it twice
and then dot, dot, dot.

1280
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,460
OK?

1281
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,615
That is encoding
a_i in unary-- or I

1282
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:05,740
don't know if there's
something smaller than unary,

1283
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,160
where you use three objects
to represent one unit,

1284
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,750
but there you go.

1285
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,410
And then at the end
of the a_i, we're

1286
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,650
going to sort of finish
things off and reset

1287
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:22,250
to this original kind of
configuration by saying square

1288
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,780
and straight.

1289
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,280
OK?

1290
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,930
So the square nestles in there.

1291
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,530
We get a straight.

1292
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,010
And if all goes according
to plan, what you've done

1293
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:34,390
is filled up basically
a_i units of this thing.

1294
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,610
And maybe plus 1.

1295
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,090
But we know there's only three
a_i's going into each bucket,

1296
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:43,190
so we can deal with a plus
additive 3, that's no big deal.

1297
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,560
And that's good.

1298
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,390
So now you have a choice.

1299
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,640
You have this long sequence
of pieces representing a_i.

1300
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,181
In general, the piece sequences
is the piece sequence for a_1,

1301
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:55,640
the piece sequence for
a_2, piece sequence for a_3.

1302
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,220
The intent is, you put
all of these pieces

1303
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,220
into one column, one
of these buckets.

1304
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,860
The claim is you can't against
the divisibility issue.

1305
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,092
The big issue is, can we
divide a_i into two parts?

1306
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,550
Put part of it in one bucket,
part of it in another bucket.

1307
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,320
That would not give us a
solution to 3-partition.

1308
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,400
But the claim is you can't.

1309
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,480
And the proof of this claim is
not too hard for this proof.

1310
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,950
It was much more tedious
for the original proof.

1311
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,340
But basically, you
try everything else

1312
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,560
and show that you're doomed.

1313
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,480
So every other possible move.

1314
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,580
So one type of bad
move, so when you

1315
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,930
do this thing of putting
in the right-ward facing L,

1316
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,160
remember, there's only
right-ward facing L's, there's

1317
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,761
only n of them, one per a_i.

1318
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:47,670
So that's the only
sort of nice piece.

1319
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,620
We call this priming a bucket.

1320
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,340
Because now it has a
nice flat bottom and so,

1321
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,210
these pieces fit nicely,
especially the squares.

1322
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,500
So one issue is, what if
you have an unprimed bucket?

1323
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,730
It still has this
stuff over on the left,

1324
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,530
and you try to just
insert into it.

1325
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,710
Because the first a_i comes,
you prime one of the buckets.

1326
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,220
What if you switch
midstream and try

1327
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,360
to move the rest into
an unprimed bucket?

1328
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,675
The claim is, you die.

1329
00:58:10,675 --> 00:58:12,300
You look at the
squares, you say, well,

1330
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,720
if could go here
or here or higher.

1331
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,370
And they're all bad.

1332
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:19,300
This one means you'll
never fill this stuff,

1333
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,400
so you're basically
going to run out of area.

1334
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,160
Something's going to
have to go into the sky.

1335
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,390
If you put this here, you'll
never get anything here.

1336
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,730
Put that there, you'll
never get anything here.

1337
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,610
The squares won't fit
anymore and so on.

1338
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,210
L's can't go pass
through that thing.

1339
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:34,710
OK.

1340
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,060
Similarly, if you try to
put a straight away in,

1341
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,580
something bad happens.

1342
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,640
I don't quite remember
what the bad thing is here,

1343
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,460
but that looks-- right.

1344
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,910
Once you cover one, you
can't cover the other.

1345
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,410
Yeah.

1346
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,285
It's not even obvious
you can cover this one,

1347
00:58:49,285 --> 00:58:52,591
but I think with some
clever rotation you can.

1348
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:55,660
Tetris is a little
weird in that respect.

1349
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,722
And then, with the
left-ward facing L's, you

1350
00:58:58,722 --> 00:58:59,680
can try all the things.

1351
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,110
And again, you're toast.

1352
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:06,140
So that's one type of bad thing,
where you switch midstream

1353
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,032
from one of-- you start
putting an a_i into a bucket,

1354
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:10,990
and then you try to put
it into a bucket that's

1355
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,900
currently unprimed.

1356
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:21,340
So what's left is, if
you stick to one bucket,

1357
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,070
do you have to play
like we want to play?

1358
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,056
And so, in the
sequence of pieces,

1359
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:28,430
when you haven't
placed anything,

1360
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,888
well, maybe you try to prime
it in a different way and then

1361
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:32,117
that opens up something else.

1362
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:34,200
Then you'd have to go
through that entire analysis

1363
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,460
in the last side again for
however the unprimed bucket

1364
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,280
might look.

1365
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,740
But it turns out, however
you do it, you're toast.

1366
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,660
You've hidden some square which
you won't be able to open up.

1367
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,400
Unless you do it the right way.

1368
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,030
And once you've
done that piece, you

1369
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,940
check that the next piece
has only one place to go.

1370
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,880
Obviously if it's to the
left, then those are not good.

1371
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,390
And then, the next
piece and so on.

1372
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,957
So you check all these things.

1373
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,790
And you conclude there's
really only one way

1374
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,600
to play this sequence.

1375
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,860
Except for the flexibility of
when a new a_i stream comes,

1376
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,700
which bucket do I put it in?

1377
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,340
We're assuming here
infinite dexterity.

1378
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,350
So you can slide to
the left and right,

1379
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:16,010
pick the bucket you want,
and then let it fall.

1380
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,100
Questions?

1381
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,600
Yeah.

1382
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,840
AUDIENCE: So you set
up the infrastructure

1383
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,999
so that if you leave even
one space unfilled, then

1384
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:26,550
you're going to die
before you get the T?

1385
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,570
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1386
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:34,860
So the idea is that if you
leave any square out here,

1387
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,280
you will be in trouble.

1388
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,290
And there are probably
many ways to do this.

1389
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,480
And I forget exactly
what we do in the paper.

1390
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,130
I think the easy one would be
that, if you put any square up

1391
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,960
here, you die.

1392
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,550
So you're right at
the limit of the game.

1393
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,130
If anything doesn't go into
a bucket, you're in trouble.

1394
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,029
And then it's just
a volume argument.

1395
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,320
So you've got all these pieces.

1396
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,090
The total volume
of them is exactly

1397
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,150
the sum of the bucket sizes.

1398
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,140
So if you leave any
blank space, that

1399
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,400
means that the
material that was there

1400
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,150
is going to somehow
end up on the top row.

1401
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,182
And then you're dead.

1402
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:14,140
I don't remember if that's
exactly what we did,

1403
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,960
but that certainly
seems to work.

1404
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,320
Adam?

1405
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,630
AUDIENCE: If you place something
too high, but at the same time

1406
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,790
finish a line, do you die?

1407
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:28,040
And assuming not,
could we force our way

1408
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,040
through the block early?

1409
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,810
PROFESSOR: I believe
in real Tetris,

1410
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,350
if you clear a line, that
happens before you potentially

1411
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,200
die.

1412
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,810
I don't think that's
an issue here,

1413
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,530
because you won't be
able to clear anything

1414
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,810
until the T piece.

1415
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:46,040
So I think you use the
argument I said up to here.

1416
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,290
There are no other T's
in the construction.

1417
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:51,120
So any other piece you try
to put in here, I think,

1418
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,470
will get you above this row.

1419
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,660
And then you die.

1420
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,284
So that's essentially
unusable space until the T

1421
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:58,700
And then, up until
that point, you

1422
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,940
have to exactly
fill all the stuff.

1423
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,850
Yeah.

1424
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,420
AUDIENCE: So if we
ignore filling the lower

1425
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,520
stuff in the main
gadgets and just

1426
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,340
stick something up
high and just try

1427
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,170
to fill just the
tops of each of them,

1428
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:20,186
so that with an L or something
we can clear one space of the--

1429
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:21,060
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

1430
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,595
You could try to put an
L like that or like this.

1431
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:31,870
Yeah, but it if the row
clears first-- all right.

1432
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:35,490
Now I have to look up
the rules, I guess.

1433
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:35,990
Yeah.

1434
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,490
AUDIENCE: I think it might be
OK because then there's no way

1435
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,752
ever to fill the next part.

1436
01:02:40,752 --> 01:02:42,460
PROFESSOR: Let's talk
about this offline.

1437
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,482
I think there's something to
check here, which hopefully we

1438
01:02:45,482 --> 01:02:46,190
did in the paper.

1439
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,250
But I've by now forgotten.

1440
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,100
Just for fun, if you
succeed, at the end,

1441
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,230
you get all of these
right-ward facing L's.

1442
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,114
Then you get the T.
Those lines clear

1443
01:02:56,114 --> 01:02:58,280
and then you get all the
I's and it's so satisfying,

1444
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,220
all those Tetrises.

1445
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,020
And then, if you're-- so a
Tetris is when you get four

1446
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,550
rows in one move, which can
only be done with the straights.

1447
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,730
So this is, if you
survive, then you

1448
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,990
clear a whole bunch of columns.

1449
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,850
But if you want to make
it really embarrassing,

1450
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,620
then you put this
entire construction

1451
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,620
over a nice big wall,
big empty space,

1452
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,390
and you put a whole bunch
of pieces at the end,

1453
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,650
like let's say L's all of the
same orientation or something.

1454
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,250
Those are really easy to pack.

1455
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,370
So if you want to
maximize your score

1456
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,970
and you don't solve
this thing, then you're

1457
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,250
really going to lose bad.

1458
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,904
Because if you do
solve this thing,

1459
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:41,320
you're going to
get tons of points

1460
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,110
by just playing in here forever.

1461
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:48,270
So n to the 1 minus epsilon
of the game is down here.

1462
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,970
And if you can't solve
this thing at the top,

1463
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:53,920
then you're getting a
score of basically zero.

1464
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,680
I mean, you do
place a few pieces,

1465
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,145
but very small compared to the
number of things down here,

1466
01:03:58,145 --> 01:03:59,770
you place like n to
the epsilon pieces.

1467
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:04,765
Whereas if you do succeed, then
you get to place all n pieces.

1468
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,910
This is just the
initial configuration,

1469
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,210
or which floating square?

1470
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,230
This thing?

1471
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,980
Oh, this one.

1472
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,750
That is possible to
construct, I believe.

1473
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,200
This is a challenge.

1474
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,170
It's a whole industry of
making cool initial patterns

1475
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,670
by playing a lot of things.

1476
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,130
So in fact, there's a paper
by Hoogeboom and Kosters

1477
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,250
that shows that any
reasonable Tetris

1478
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,100
configuration can be constructed
from an initially empty board.

1479
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:44,470
And so, what we get is
to approximate Tetris,

1480
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:55,500
let's say the number of pieces
that you play, less than n

1481
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:04,840
to the 1 minus epsilon
factor is NP-hard.

1482
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,810
That's what we just
showed or sketched.

1483
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:10,470
So this is an example of an
inapproximability result.

1484
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,720
This is a relatively easy one.

1485
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,037
We just need to assume
P does not equal NP.

1486
01:05:14,037 --> 01:05:15,870
And we get that you
really can't approximate

1487
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,150
within a very good factor.

1488
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,170
It's sort of all or
nothing in this game.

1489
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,040
Later in the class, we'll
see much more subtle

1490
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,145
inapproximability results.

1491
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:28,180
Other questions?

1492
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,320
Hopefully no more issues.

1493
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,110
There are a lot of other
open problems about Tetris.

1494
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:35,820
You mentioned construction.

1495
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,740
What if the board
is initially empty?

1496
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:40,091
Seems like quite a challenging
problem, constant number

1497
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,090
of rows or columns here.

1498
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:43,540
We assume that both dimensions
are arbitrarily large,

1499
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,980
it's part of the input.

1500
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,410
But these seem very annoying.

1501
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,500
Interesting.

1502
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,660
If you just have straights, I
imagine Tetris is pretty easy.

1503
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,940
So how many of the
Tetris pieces do you

1504
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,870
need to get a harness
proof or are there certain

1505
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,970
small combinations
that are easy?

1506
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,012
We need this ability to
slide at the last minute.

1507
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:04,220
Be nice if you could just
always be hitting space bar

1508
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,346
and always drop your pieces
from positive infinity.

1509
01:06:06,346 --> 01:06:08,428
We don't know whether that
problem is NP-complete.

1510
01:06:08,428 --> 01:06:09,960
That might be the
most tractable,

1511
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,360
but it's proof would have
to be a little different.

1512
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,699
Two-player Tetris,
online Tetris where

1513
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:16,240
you don't know the
pieces in advance,

1514
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,540
that's something we might
get to later in the class.

1515
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,360
But these are all open.

1516
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,660
OK.

1517
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,670
So next topic is
in graph theory.

1518
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:30,910
So suppose you have a
graph, vertices and edges,

1519
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,990
you want to draw it in the
plane of no two vertices

1520
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,430
touching, no vertex on an edge.

1521
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:37,090
That's a regular
notion I'm drawing,

1522
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,550
but edges are allowed to cross.

1523
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,420
If you're lucky,
graph is planar.

1524
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,510
Don't need any crossings.

1525
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:43,830
There's this notion of
1-planarity, which goes back

1526
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:46,080
to the '80s, where
every edge can

1527
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,000
cross at most one other edge.

1528
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,050
So this is an example
of a one-planar drawing.

1529
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,045
Some edges don't cross
anything, but any edge that

1530
01:06:54,045 --> 01:06:56,620
has a crossing only has one.

1531
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,120
OK?

1532
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:01,816
So this is NP-complete.

1533
01:07:01,816 --> 01:07:05,030
On a notion of strong
here, there's no numbers.

1534
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:09,540
This is from 2007 and a
reduction from 3-partition.

1535
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:14,200
So here are two gadgets.

1536
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,450
This is a double--
well, OK, we'll

1537
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,440
get to this one in a moment.

1538
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,390
Here's a gadget which
is the complete graph

1539
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,500
on six vertices, K_6.

1540
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,410
And the idea is that we're
going to plug this in instead

1541
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,180
of a single, bold edge.

1542
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,870
So wherever there's a bold
edge here, what it really means

1543
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,260
is this gadget.

1544
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:33,760
OK?

1545
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,950
This is meant to be
an uncrossable edge,

1546
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,570
because usually an edge can
take up to one crossing.

1547
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:40,820
What we're going to replace
this edge with this thing,

1548
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,700
which has a bunch
of crossings in it,

1549
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,800
no matter how you draw it.

1550
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,220
K_6 is very symmetric,
so it's not

1551
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,810
too hard to argue about
the different drawings.

1552
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:50,030
We see a crossing
there, a crossing there,

1553
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,560
and a crossing there.

1554
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,240
And in general, if you look
at any path from this vertex

1555
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,039
to this vertex, you
visit a crossing.

1556
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:03,209
There's no way to get--
wait, what about this one?

1557
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:04,020
What do I mean?

1558
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,680
If I attempt to draw
an edge through here,

1559
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,999
I will hit an edge that
has a crossing on it.

1560
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:11,169
That's what I want.

1561
01:08:11,169 --> 01:08:13,520
So in other words, it's
not possible to draw

1562
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,910
an edge across here
and still be 1-planer

1563
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:18,180
So this effectively becomes
an uncrossable edge.

1564
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,050
This is notation.

1565
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,430
This is super useful.

1566
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,520
When you have a
complicated construction,

1567
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,340
if you use the
right notation, it's

1568
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,999
not necessarily so complicated.

1569
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:28,230
If we drew this everywhere
in these pictures,

1570
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,329
it would be really hard
to see what's going on.

1571
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:34,660
So we use this visual idea
that this is a symbol for that.

1572
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,660
And then we can draw
really simple pictures,

1573
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,140
relatively simple pictures.

1574
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,140
This is what's called
a double wheel.

1575
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,680
It's got a lot of spokes
in the center.

1576
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,160
And a cycle around there.

1577
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,160
And just another one around there.

1578
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,740
And we're going to have two of them.
There's gonna be exactly two of these gadgets.

1579
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:58,660
One of size sum-of-the-a's.
The other of size n.

1580
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,640
Okay, so in this picture we have six a_i's,

1581
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,060
and the sum of all of them is however
many spokes are on that wheel.

1582
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,220
Okay. And then this is
 the actual construction.

1583
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:13,080
So this is... they are...
This is the a_i gadget.

1584
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,300
So let's look at this one.
This is when a_i equals 3.

1585
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,000
We're gonna have a vertex
of degree 3+1.

1586
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,800
This path is a path of length 2.

1587
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,360
And it goes to this vertex, the center of
the smaller wheel, of the end wheel.

1588
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,400
And then these... The other three paths,
again, are of length 2.

1589
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:40,320
And they connect to the center of
the sum of the a_i's gadget.

1590
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,080
So this is intended to
represent the number 3.

1591
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:47,480
Now there's a little bit more going on,
which is we added a bold edge here,

1592
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,380
and a bold edge here.

1593
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,480
In this case-- here's A, in case
you're curious-- In this case, n/3 is 2.

1594
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,760
So, in general, we have the sum of all...

1595
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,260
We have all of the a_i's basically
laid out here, in some order.

1596
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,300
And what we're trying to do,
is partition them into groups of size t.

1597
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,860
So here t is
whatever this number is.

1598
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,960
And so we add these uncrossable edges

1599
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,640
to say, well, an a_i cannot go
partly in this bin and partly in this bin.

1600
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,640
It's gotta choose which side of
all of these bold lines it's on.

1601
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,480
And so, for each a_i, you choose--

1602
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,820
In this case, there's only two bins,
but in general there'd be several bins, each

1603
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:29,240
delineated by a bold edge from the end of the thing

1604
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,900
the thing to the end of
the thing over there.

1605
01:10:33,909 --> 01:10:35,450
I mean, this looks
a little bit weird

1606
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,479
like, OK, how do the a_i's choose
which side they're on here?

1607
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:40,520
Well, they just choose
whichever side they're on.

1608
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,510
If they're in the
bottom chunk over here,

1609
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,940
then they'll just connect to
the bottom chunk over here.

1610
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,523
If they're in the
top chunk over here,

1611
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:50,440
they'll connect to the
corresponding chunk over there.

1612
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,930
This is basically
to force the a_i's

1613
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:56,710
to start on the outside
of this construction.

1614
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,544
So there's a lot of, again,
there's a lot of cases

1615
01:10:59,544 --> 01:11:01,960
here to worry about, about
other ways you might draw this.

1616
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,810
Maybe you'd take
this entire picture

1617
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:05,820
and stuff it into
this little triangle.

1618
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,360
They all end up with lots of
crossings on a single edge.

1619
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,390
If you do that,
then you have to go,

1620
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:15,350
you have to cross this edge
many times, for example.

1621
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,090
I think we convinced ourselves
that with a single wheel,

1622
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:23,407
without this extra thing,
the construction, I think,

1623
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:25,740
we are not certain about
whether the construction works.

1624
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,054
There's definitely
more cases to consider.

1625
01:11:28,054 --> 01:11:29,720
So at the very least,
it simplify things

1626
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,220
by adding a second wheel.

1627
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,140
It would also mean you'd have
to have multiple edges here

1628
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,430
between the same two vertices.

1629
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,060
So maybe that's why they
did the double wheel,

1630
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,230
so that you have these
paths of length 2 connecting

1631
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:44,120
the same thing instead
of the exact same edge.

1632
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,520
Anyway, so again,
you have to proof.

1633
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,410
This is essentially
only one planar bedding

1634
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,380
for each of these wheels.

1635
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,760
And for these things to
connect them together.

1636
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,970
And so, the a_i's have the
freedom of which bucket

1637
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:57,950
they go into.

1638
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:01,630
But because each of these
edges can only be crossed once,

1639
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:05,910
each unit of each
a_i-- only one unit

1640
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,940
can occupy each of these cells.

1641
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,300
So you get 3-partition.

1642
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,520
Cool?

1643
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,680
Yet another way to
represent numbers in unary.

1644
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,484
Question?

1645
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:20,760
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
how-- what those numbers are.

1646
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,140
PROFESSOR: So OK, so these are
the a_i's-- a_1 is 2, a_2 is 3,

1647
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,140
a_3 is 3, a_4 is 3,
a_5 is 4, and a_6 is 5.

1648
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:34,050
And they are represented
by, this thing is a 2,

1649
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,920
this thing is a 3, this thing
is 3, this thing is a 4,

1650
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,260
and this is a 5.

1651
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,610
And that should be
in the same sequence.

1652
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:44,610
I think I missed this 3.

1653
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:49,920
Good.

1654
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,290
OK, that was 1-planarity.

1655
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,990
Four minutes-- which
proofs to cover?

1656
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,710
I will wave my
hands at this one.

1657
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:07,790
This is a chain of blocks
with hinges on them.

1658
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,890
And it has colors on it.

1659
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:12,660
Your goal is to form a
particular pattern of colors.

1660
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,860
I find it interesting,
this is our hardness proof.

1661
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,395
It's interesting in that
it's-- a lot of the proofs

1662
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,730
you've seen, it's all
about making the a_i's being

1663
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:21,890
a straight line.

1664
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,610
Here, that's not a big deal.

1665
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:28,157
We've sort of drawn out--
this is, again, a kind

1666
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:29,240
of universal construction.

1667
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,970
You could build any
polyomino with it.

1668
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,610
It's all about the colors.

1669
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,100
And so, the idea
is that the a_i's

1670
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,260
are represented by how
long of a blue segment

1671
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,850
you have here in the
overall chain of pieces.

1672
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:42,190
And these are the buckets.

1673
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:44,460
And so, you just
come in at some point

1674
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,045
and fill in however big
your a_i is and then leave.

1675
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:50,170
And there's just enough
blue to cover all the blue.

1676
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,139
So you'd better not waste it.

1677
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:54,430
But all the other stuff, you
have a lot of flexibility.

1678
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,710
So it's all about just kind of
filling these amorphous blobs

1679
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:01,510
that have exactly the right
area to fill these blue regions.

1680
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,600
And there's three times
you're allowed to visit.

1681
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,058
And that gives you
3-partition.

1682
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:06,447
So I want-- it's
hard, especially

1683
01:14:06,447 --> 01:14:08,280
without a physical
model, to understand what

1684
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,404
the rules are at this game.

1685
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:11,132
But it gives you some
idea of another way

1686
01:14:11,132 --> 01:14:12,340
to represent 3-partition.

1687
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,620
Next, you may have seen
this kind of object.

1688
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,510
It is called a
carpenter's ruler or rule.

1689
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,650
It's got hinges.

1690
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,960
It's got rigid bars.

1691
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,000
And usually, when you're
not using it-- I mean,

1692
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,340
you can measure lengths,
that's the ruler part.

1693
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,050
And when you're not
using it, it folds

1694
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,740
into this nice, compact form.

1695
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,400
It's great.

1696
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,340
And everyone used these
until the invention

1697
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,670
of the retractable one.

1698
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,880
Though they still use
these a lot in Europe.

1699
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,270
So has unit length in this case.

1700
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,200
But what if you have a really
annoying carpenter's rule

1701
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,810
and the lengths
are not all equal?

1702
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,480
And you have this nice box which
is unit length or, you know,

1703
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,350
some length.

1704
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:59,100
You'd like to fit your ruler
into that one-dimensional box.

1705
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,980
Let's ignore the thickness here.

1706
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:01,890
OK?

1707
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:05,410
Then this problem is hard.

1708
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,900
It is weakly NP-hard.

1709
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,460
You can solve it in
pseudopolynomial time.

1710
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,440
So this is what-- this is like
one of the very few problems

1711
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,120
we'll see of this type.

1712
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,340
And this is the proof.

1713
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,580
It's one of the simplest proofs
from reduction from partition,

1714
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,721
which is 2-partition, which
is divide your numbers into two

1715
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:23,220
groups.

1716
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,200
And I apologize here.

1717
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,370
In this book of ours,
we use x instead of a.

1718
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,130
So those are a_i's.

1719
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,240
So you're given some a_i's.

1720
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,510
And the idea is,
well, if I would

1721
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,900
like to partition the a_i's
into two groups of equal sums,

1722
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,210
like so, that's
the same as saying,

1723
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:41,630
well, some of the a_i's, or the
x_i's, are going to go left.

1724
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,180
Some of them are
going to go right.

1725
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,430
And whether I fold something--
I could either leave it

1726
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:49,379
at 180 degrees or I could
fold it to 0 degrees, that's

1727
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:50,920
sort of my binary
choice if I'm going

1728
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,360
to go into one-dimensional
box-- if I fold it,

1729
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,640
I change direction.

1730
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,820
If I don't fold it, I stay
in the same direction.

1731
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,900
But what that really means is,
by something running summation

1732
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,650
thing, I can choose for each a_i
whether it goes left or right.

1733
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:05,150
OK?

1734
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:07,690
And then, this is
gonna-- if this happens,

1735
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:11,040
what it means is my starting
point is equal to my ending

1736
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:11,860
point.

1737
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,950
Now, could be in between.

1738
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,020
I go left and right and
who knows what happens.

1739
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,070
But the point is, if they sum up
to the lefts equal the rights,

1740
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,930
then my starting point will
be horizontally aligned

1741
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,850
with my ending point.

1742
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,620
So that's not the problem.

1743
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,490
The problem is to fit into
a box of a given size.

1744
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,570
So this says nothing
about the box.

1745
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,740
But, if you do this very
simple construction,

1746
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,640
which is add a super-long
length and then add

1747
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,750
half of that at the beginning.

1748
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,410
And then, at the
end, you add half

1749
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:43,050
of the long length and
then the super-long length,

1750
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,460
and your goal is to fit
it in a box of equal

1751
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,560
to the super-long length, that
will be possible if and only

1752
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,740
if these are aligned.

1753
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,932
If they're not aligned, then
if you go halfway left or right

1754
01:16:53,932 --> 01:16:55,390
and then add the
super-long length,

1755
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,880
if it's not aligned
with this one,

1756
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,379
then you'll be a
little bit too big.

1757
01:16:58,379 --> 01:16:59,650
And you won't fit in the box.

1758
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,150
OK?

1759
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:03,280
So that represents
2-partition.

1760
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,710
Cool.

1761
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:08,480
20 seconds, one more proof.

1762
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,070
So here's another problem.

1763
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,425
Map folding.

1764
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:13,800
You've probably
done this before.

1765
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,604
Easiest way to refold a
roadmap is differently.

1766
01:17:17,604 --> 01:17:19,270
Generally, what we're
interested in here

1767
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,540
is just very simple folds.

1768
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,370
Fold along one line, then fold
along another line and so on.

1769
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,070
OK?

1770
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:27,250
So, this is NP-hard.

1771
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,780
If I give you a
crease pattern, this

1772
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,820
doesn't look much like a map,
but we can talk about that.

1773
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:37,250
If I give you a map, a polygon,
and some creases on it.

1774
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,870
And I want to fold
all of these creases,

1775
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:43,950
this is possible if and only
if 2-partition is solvable.

1776
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,350
Notice these lengths--
here we used a's.

1777
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,810
That's smart of us.

1778
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,800
So these are the a_i's
down the distances

1779
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,730
between these creases,
consecutive creases.

1780
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:56,180
And again, the idea is, well,
I can fold each one or not.

1781
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,940
And just like the carpenters
rule, I can fold or not.

1782
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:03,160
And if I am clever and I do
it with the right choice,

1783
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,980
then this endpoint.

1784
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,660
Will be vertically aligned,
have the same y-coordinate

1785
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,980
as this endpoint.

1786
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,647
And if I do that--
and again, we've

1787
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,480
added half of the
super-long length and then

1788
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,850
the super-long length here.

1789
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,000
There's also the half
of the super-long length

1790
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,830
and the super-long length there.

1791
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:23,010
And now I can fold
these two folds.

1792
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,420
So when I fold one,
it's going to go here.

1793
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:29,810
And it won't hit anything if and
only if I solve 2-partition.

1794
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:30,310
Right?

1795
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:33,880
Again, this is the box that I'm
trying to fit everything into

1796
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,739
and this is the
thing that I'm trying

1797
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:38,030
to shift up and down to be
perfectly aligned with that.

1798
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,620
If I can perfectly
aligned it, then I

1799
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,710
fold this, miss, then fold
this and it's out again.

1800
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,670
And then I can finish
these other creases

1801
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,350
that I haven't folded yet.

1802
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,850
OK?

1803
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,215
So it's all about when do
you execute these two folds?

1804
01:18:52,215 --> 01:18:55,480
And so I'm going to do some
of the horizontal folds

1805
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,020
so that things fit nicely.

1806
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,930
Then I'll do the
two vertical folds.

1807
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:01,080
Then I'll do the rest
of the horizontal folds.

1808
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,250
And that will work if and only
if 2-partition is solvable.

1809
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,410
Now, this may look
like a weird map,

1810
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:12,733
but it turns out if you have a
regular rectangular map-- this

1811
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:15,470
is not maybe a regular
one, but-- and you

1812
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:20,850
have some diagonal
folds, 45 degree, then

1813
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:33,710
that will basically force you
to fold something like this.

1814
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,690
Oops, I did it again.

1815
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:48,010
One, two, and then here.

1816
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,750
So you can put in
diagonal faults

1817
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,620
to force you to fold into
this initial structure.

1818
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,810
And then add folds
on top of that.

1819
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,911
So this is like
composing two gadgets.

1820
01:19:56,911 --> 01:19:58,660
Then you add horizontal
and vertical folds

1821
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,060
just like that picture.

1822
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,000
And then you'll have
a rectangular map

1823
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,660
with horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal creases

1824
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:07,270
that you can fold all the
creases by simple folds if

1825
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,820
and only if two
partition is solvable.

1826
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,530
Open problem, is this
strongly NP-hard?

1827
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:13,375
We don't know.

1828
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,000
Is there a
pseudopolynomial algorithm?

1829
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,570
Obviously we don't know.

1830
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,680
It's quite tantalizing.

1831
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,360
But this is basically why maps
don't have diagonal folds.

1832
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,730
And that's it for today.
